",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Introduction and Objectives: We initiated this multicenter study to integrate important risk factors to create a nomogram for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for clinician decision-making. Patients and Methods: Between April 2011 and March 2022, 2281 HCC patients with an HBV-related diagnosis were included. All patients were randomly divided into two groups in a ratio of 7:3 (training cohort, n = 1597; validation cohort, n = 684). The nomogram was built in the training cohort via Cox regression model and validated in the validation cohort. Results: Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that the portal vein tumor thrombus, Child–Pugh class, tumor diameter, alanine aminotransferase level, tumor number, extrahepatic metastases, and therapy were independent predictive variables impacting overall survival. We constructed a new nomogram to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates based on these factors. The nomogram-related receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.809, 0.806, and 0.764 in predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, respectively. Furthermore, the calibration curves revealed good agreement between real measurements and nomogram predictions. The decision curve analyses (DCA) curves demonstrated excellent therapeutic application potential. In addition, stratified by risk scores, low-risk groups had longer median OS than medium–high-risk groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The nomogram we constructed showed good performance in predicting the 1-year survival rate for HBV- related HCC.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Benchmarking a two-way coupled coastal wave–current hydrodynamics model,/articles/benchmarking-two-way-coupled-coastal-wave%E2%80%93current-hydrodynamics-model,"This paper develops a coupling between SWAN and Thetis models to account for wave–current interactions occurring by the co-existence of wave and current flows. The different grids and time-steps employed by the model components allow greater flexibility. The two models run consecutively, and communicate internally to exchange the necessary parameters. These are the significant wave height, mean wave direction, mean wavelength and percentage of wave-breaking calculated by SWAN necessary for calculating radiation stress and wave roller effects, while Thetis provides water elevation and current velocity fields.
",Goal 14: Life below water,"Wave–current interaction phenomena are often represented through coupled model frameworks in ocean modelling. However, benchmarking of these models is scarce, revealing a substantial research challenge. We seek to address this through a selection of cases for coupled wave–current interaction modelling. This comprises a series of analytical and experimental test cases spanning three diverse conditions of wave run-up, one scenario of waves opposing a current flow, and a 2-D arrangement of waves propagating over a submerged bar. We simulate these through coupling the spectral wave model, Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN), with the coastal hydrodynamics shallow-water equation model, Thetis, using the Basic Model Interface (BMI) structure. By comparing calibrated versus default parameter settings we identify and highlight calibration uncertainties that emerge across a range of potential applications. Calibrated model results exhibit good correlation against experimental and analytical data, alongside benchmarked wave–current model predictions, where available. Specifically, inter-model comparisons show equivalent accuracy. Finally, the coupled model we developed as part of this work showcases its ability to account for wave–current effects, in a manner extensible to other coupled processes through BMI and applicable to more complex geometries.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
The importance of resolving nearshore currents in coastal dispersal models,/articles/importance-resolving-nearshore-currents-coastal-dispersal-models,"This paper is particularly relevant to investigations into the spread of organisms that remain close to shore over timescales of days-to-weeks, e.g., the spread of marine non-native species and pathogenetic parasites, but is equally relevant to simulations tracking the dispersal of eDNA or coastal pollutants such as oil and plastics.
",Goal 14: Life below water; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Biophysical models often require shelf-scale domains to map larval dispersal over several weeks, presenting a computational challenge. This can be overcome by decreasing model spatial resolution; however, nearshore processes, which potentially play a significant role in larval dispersal, will inevitably be unresolved. Here, we evaluate how simulated larval dispersal in the nearshore is sensitive to model spatial resolution. We use an unstructured, finite element, hydrodynamic model of a topographically-complex coastline in North Wales, UK (which includes headlands, bays and channels) at four different spatial scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m) to compare the influence of spatial resolution on transport and dispersal patterns of particles released within the nearshore region (within 1 km of the shore). In the higher resolution (50 and 100 m) simulations, particles generally travelled offshore more quickly and further (∼18%) than in the coarser (250 and 500 m) simulations. This had important implications for potential connectivity along the coast: for the lower resolution simulations, retention of particles near source sites was increased by ∼50% and, whilst the magnitude of connectivity among discrete regions along the coast was also increased (by ∼27%), the number of connected regions was reduced (by ∼9%), compared with the higher resolution simulations. Our results, based on a case study in a highly energetic and topographically complex region, suggest that model spatial resolution of ≤100 m should be used for dispersal studies in the nearshore zone. These findings add to growing evidence of the importance of using appropriately scaled models when simulating the transport of material within – and out of – the coastal zone, with many applications, such as marine ecology, marine biosecurity, marine spatial planning and marine pollution.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Typically, new technologies and new activities have been delivered to farmers through a ‘technology-push’, designed and supported by governments, non-government organisations and donor community, yet rates of adoption are disappointingly low. In this paper we set out to explore barriers and enablers for engagement in a new aquaculture activity, as perceived by the intended farmers. Our example is of ‘technology-push’ towards seaweed farming in coastal villages in Samoa. To increase the likelihood of greater adoption in the future, we explored perceptions of the intended beneficiaries by conducting 20 focus group discussions with 135 women and men, in 10 villages. Specifically, we explored their perceptions of seaweed as an industry, as well as perceptions of barriers and enablers linked to the key market system components: core production functions (inputs and outputs); supporting functions (such as transport, finance, training); institutional barriers; and personal agency. We found that a set of inputs seen as ‘essential’ was much broader than inputs suggested in market systems studies. Essential inputs included not only materials, tools, equipment and labour, but also extended to include information, knowledge and skills; farm governance and protection of the farms; personal agency; and environmental context. What emerged from our data is a clear division of what participants saw as solutions that can be resolved by them (such as arranging informal institutions) versus solutions that need to be provided externally (such as tools, skills, financing and markets) for which the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was seen as the key external provider.

The study suggests that on-site point of care testing and treatment for HCV in supervised consumption services is effective in reaching this population
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Despite high burden of Hepatitis C (HCV) among people who inject drugs, significant barriers to care persist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the provision of rapid, low-barrier point-of-care (POC) HCV RNA testing and linkage to care among clients of a supervised consumption service (SCS) located within a community health centre in Toronto, Canada. Secondary aims included measuring HCV RNA prevalence at baseline, HCV incidence during follow-up and exploring factors associated with HCV RNA positivity and treatment uptake. Methods: Participants were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort from August 13, 2018 to September 30, 2021. Those with positive HCV RNA tests were offered immediate referral to onsite treatment. Those with negative results were offered repeat testing every three months for up to four visits. HCV incidence was estimated as the number of incident HCV infections per 100 person-years at risk, among those HCV RNA negative at baseline who returned for ≥1 follow-up visit. Missing data were reported when present. Findings: 128 participants were enrolled with four later removed due to ineligibility. At baseline, 54 of 124 eligible participants (43.5%) tested HCV RNA positive. HCV incidence was 35.1 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI: 18.9–65.3) with a cumulative incidence of 38.3% at 15 months of follow-up. Among participants HCV RNA positive at baseline or follow-up (n = 64), 67.2% (n = 43) were linked to HCV care and treatment was initiated among 67.4% (n = 29/43). Interpretation: High HCV RNA prevalence and incidence demonstrate that the SCS serves a high-risk population for HCV. Testing acceptance was high, as was treatment engagement.

The impact of immigration on hepatitis B burden in the United States: a modelling study,/articles/impact-immigration-hepatitis-b-burden-united-states-modelling-study,"This Article supports SDG 3 by using modelling to estimate the impact of immigration on hepatitis B prevalence in the USA, in order to more accurately assess the hepatitis B burden, which might not be accurately measured by national serosurveys. The study found a significantly higher burden of hepatitis B (1.8 million cases), significantly higher than that found in national serosurveys.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The 2016 World Health Assembly endorsed the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections by 2030. However, the HBV prevalence in Western countries, where the historical prevalence is low and highly impacted by immigration trends, remains uncertain making planning difficult. We aimed to develop a more accurate estimate of HBV prevalence and identify key immigrant populations that need to be screened, vaccinated, and treated to achieve the elimination targets. Methods: US immigration data from 1900 forward and country-specific modeled prevalence by age and sex were used to estimate immigrated HBV infections entering the US, new infections in the US, mortality (all-cause and liver-related), and disease burden through 2030. Findings: Using a dynamic Markov model, we estimated 1.8 million (95% uncertainty interval: 1.3–2.6 million) HBV infections in 2020 in all ages, higher than the NHANES national serosurvey. Infections between ages 30–74 accounted for 82% of all cases. Furthermore, HBV infections were concentrated among immigrants. New decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver related deaths are expected to increase by 20%, 31% and 25% respectively from 2019 to 2030 at current diagnosis and treatment rate. Interpretation: National serosurveys can underestimate total infections due to under-sampling in immigrant populations. To meet the WHO elimination targets, culturally appropriate screening and linkage to care programs in the immigrant populations are needed in the US. In their absence, there will be significant increases in the burden of HBV and the US will fail to meet the elimination targets by 2030.

To make full use of satellite observations for ocean carbon monitoring the remote-sensing community needs to work closely with in-situ data experts, physical and biogeochemical modellers, Earth system scientists, climate scientists and marine policy experts.
","Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water","The ocean plays a central role in modulating the Earth's carbon cycle. Monitoring how the ocean carbon cycle is changing is fundamental to managing climate change. Satellite remote sensing is currently our best tool for viewing the ocean surface globally and systematically, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the past few decades have seen an exponential growth in studies utilising satellite data for ocean carbon research. Satellite-based observations must be combined with in-situ observations and models, to obtain a comprehensive view of ocean carbon pools and fluxes. To help prioritise future research in this area, a workshop was organised that assembled leading experts working on the topic, from around the world, including remote-sensing scientists, field scientists and modellers, with the goal to articulate a collective view of the current status of ocean carbon research, identify gaps in knowledge, and formulate a scientific roadmap for the next decade, with an emphasis on evaluating where satellite remote sensing may contribute. A total of 449 scientists and stakeholders participated (with balanced gender representation), from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Sessions targeted both inorganic and organic pools of carbon in the ocean, in both dissolved and particulate form, as well as major fluxes of carbon between reservoirs (e.g., primary production) and at interfaces (e.g., air-sea and land–ocean). Extreme events, blue carbon and carbon budgeting were also key topics discussed. Emerging priorities identified include: expanding the networks and quality of in-situ observations; improved satellite retrievals; improved uncertainty quantification; improved understanding of vertical distributions; integration with models; improved techniques to bridge spatial and temporal scales of the different data sources; and improved fundamental understanding of the ocean carbon cycle, and of the interactions among pools of carbon and light. We also report on priorities for the specific pools and fluxes studied, and highlight issues and concerns that arose during discussions, such as the need to consider the environmental impact of satellites or space activities; the role satellites can play in monitoring ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches; economic valuation of the satellite based information; to consider how satellites can contribute to monitoring cycles of other important climatically-relevant compounds and elements; to promote diversity and inclusivity in ocean carbon research; to bring together communities working on different aspects of planetary carbon; maximising use of international bodies; to follow an open science approach; to explore new and innovative ways to remotely monitor ocean carbon; and to harness quantum computing.

Conservation for sustaining livelihoods: Adaptive co-management of fish no-take zones in the Mekong River,/articles/conservation-sustaining-livelihoods-adaptive-co-management-fish-no-take-zones-mekong-river,"A critical reflection on fisheries conservation in the Mekong River is offered here. Adaptive co-management helped balance conservation and livelihood outcomes. No-take zones facilitated basic fish conservation measures led by local fishermen. Fishermen perceiving livelihood benefits of conservation supported no-take zones. Long-term mechanisms to support community-led conservation initiatives are needed.
",Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 14: Life below water,"A major challenge in natural resource management in developing countries is to pursue conservation objectives while avoiding negative impacts on local livelihoods. Inland capture fisheries provide opportunities to demonstrate an integration of conservation and livelihood objectives when managed as a social-ecological system. While numerous marine no-take reserves have been found effective for the recovery of fisheries, few well-documented examples exist in the freshwater realm. Research gaps also remain in the role of co-management in balancing various management objectives and resolving conflicts. This paper offers critical reflection on adaptive co-management of fish conservation zones (FCZs) in the Mekong River in Cambodia and its social-ecological outcomes as perceived by local stakeholders. The management approach was found generally effective for the local stakeholders to negotiate between conservation and livelihood objectives at key stages of the implementation, and resolve conflicts; however, the lessons learned were not uniform across all sites. The degree of difficulty in conflict resolution was mainly a function of the fishing dependency of local communities on the protected site, the prevalence of severe poverty in adjacent villages, and the availability of livelihood options other than fishing. Growing stakeholder perception over time, of the FCZs as yielding positive outcomes—for both conservation and livelihood—motivated the local communities to create more FCZs. We argue clear recognition by local stakeholders of the achievements and the fairness in the FCZ management, facilitated through participatory approaches, can improve their acceptance of conservation rules and enhance their effectiveness. However, long-term mechanisms to support these community initiatives technically and financially are needed. Simple yet scientifically robust approaches for tropical freshwater fisheries monitoring, including periodical assessments of indicator species, are also needed to facilitate performance evaluation of specific management measures locally.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 14: Life below water; Goal 15: Life on land,"The soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria, is an endobenthic marine bivalve species that is abundant in the intertidal and shallow-subtidal zones of eastern Canadian and New England shores. In these coastal environments, clams are subjected to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances that can result in dislodgement from the sediment. This is especially relevant for harvested clam species that are managed by a legal size limit. Herein, live clams that are too small to be retained by harvesters are discarded back onto the sediment surface. These clams must reburrow in order to survive; however, the reburrowing behaviour of these clams after being disturbed is not well known. To fill this knowledge gap, a series of five field trials were conducted in Kouchibouguac National Park, New Brunswick, Canada, during the summer and fall of 2021 to measure reburrowing rates of discarded sub-legal sized (<50 mm) soft-shell clams. Three size groups (20–30, 31–40, and 41–50 mm) of soft-shell clams were excavated and returned to the sediment surface at three different tidal levels inside protective enclosures during low tide for each trial. Time to initiate and complete reburrowing was subsequently observed over a 24 h (h) period. Results showed that reburrowing time was not affected by size class; however, reburrowing time was affected by tidal level, site, and trial. Results suggest that disturbed clams discarded onto submerged sediment surfaces (tidal levels 2 and 3) reburrow quicker than those discarded onto air-exposed sediment (tidal level 1). Reburrowing rates of subtidally-discarded clams were faster during the first three months of the study (June–August) compared to rates observed in the September trials. Comparing reburrowing rates to environmental conditions during the trials suggested that decreasing salinity in September likely drove the slower reburrowing rates compared to rates observed earlier in the season; decreasing temperatures may also have had some influence. These findings suggest that discarding sub-legal sized clams onto submerged sediment will increase the probability of clam survival via faster reburrowing, and that environmental conditions at the time of discard can affect reburrowing rates.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
Social life cycle assessment of innovative management schemes for challenging plastics waste,/articles/social-life-cycle-assessment-innovative-management-schemes-challenging-plastics-waste,"Results from this study contribute to define a complete set of environmental and social data and information, which can help European decision makers to define new criteria for sustainable management of the waste plastics of interest. A new methodological approach has been proposed: it appears able to be applied in future research projects involving innovative management options.","Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 15: Life on land; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure","The focus is on current and innovative management schemes of plastics waste coming from electric and electronic equipment, end-of-life vehicles, and construction and demolition waste. Their complex compositions, due to the presence of several polymers, different (also hazardous) additives, and non-plastics fractions, make difficult finding sustainable management options. The study aimed at an assessment of social performances of current management schemes for these challenging plastics, compared with those of alternative schemes, including advanced innovative process options (dissolution/precipitation, supercritical fluid extraction with CO2, catalytic pyrolysis). A social life cycle assessment was developed at European level, by also exploiting synergies with parallel environmental analyses. The results indicated that innovative solutions could lead to good performances for human health of workers, but also for improvement of economies of local communities and society. The still limited maturity of proposed technologies would require a sufficiently long period of economic incentives to demonstrate process validity in the recovery of polymers, suitable to be accepted by the market. Accordingly, the estimated potential social effects should be further studied when the proposed innovative processes will be implemented at larger scale, to include aspects strictly related to the behaviour of a specific company going beyond the single process.

A literature review and analytical framework of the sustainability of reusable packaging,/articles/literature-review-and-analytical-framework-sustainability-reusable-packaging,"This study aims to identify the factors that constrain and enable the sustainability of reusable packaging systems, considering environmental, economic, social and technical dimensions. This research is critical to the effective implementation and scale-up of reusable packaging systems.","Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 15: Life on land; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure","Over 161 million tonnes of plastic packaging is produced annually, yet only a small fraction of plastic packaging is recycled. To help eliminate unnecessary plastic packaging and its associated pollution, interest is growing in reusable packaging systems, such as returnable and refillable packaging. However, it cannot be assumed that reusable packaging systems will be more sustainable than single-use alternatives. This article conducts a literature review of 107 articles on reusable packaging to develop an analytical framework that identifies 22 major factors which influence the sustainability of reusable packaging systems. This framework helps readers to better understand the complex interplay between the environmental, economic, social and technical aspects which affect the implementation and scale-up of reusable packaging solutions. The findings highlight that customer acceptance and retention is key to unlocking long-term sustainability. In addition, improving the return rate of reusable packaging, shortening the supply chain and increasing system standardisation are important factors for enabling sustainability. Switching from single-use to reusable packaging systems involves a complex systems change that requires greater collaboration between industry stakeholders, as well as greater academic collaboration between different disciplines. To progress the field, the authors call for future research to incorporate more multidisciplinary perspectives, which may include perspectives from product-service system design, circular design and policy roadmapping.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
The EU Bioeconomy Footprint: Using life cycle assessment to monitor environmental impacts of the EU Bioeconomy,/articles/eu-bioeconomy-footprint-using-life-cycle-assessment-monitor-environmental-impacts-eu,"This paper explores the potential implementation of the Consumption Footprint rationale to define a footprint indicator for the EU Bioeconomy, henceforth ‘Bioeconomy Footprint’. This indicator can be a powerful tool for a comprehensive and effective monitoring of the bioeconomy sectors: to capture environmental impacts over time, identifying environmental hotspots, highlighting geographic and sectorial trade-offs, and identifying burden shifts among impact categories and along the supply chain.","Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 15: Life on land; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure","From an environmental perspective, the transition from a fossil to a bio-based economy may underpin some trade-offs associated to the environmental impacts of bio-based supply chains and, there is thus a need to have an effective monitoring system. The goal of this paper is to develop a Life Cycle Assessment-based Bioeconomy Footprint to assess and monitor along time the environmental impacts of the EU bioeconomy. The composition of the Bioeconomy Footprint was defined in two steps: (a) defining the sectors to be included, and (b) selecting the representative products per sector; resulting in the inclusion of 76 representative final products covering eight bio-economy sectors. The overall impact is quantified based on the consumption intensity and the environmental impacts of the life cycle of each representative product. The EU Bioeconomy Footprint has increased by +23 % between 2010 and 2020, which can only partly be explained by the increase of population (+1–2 %). Food consumption has the highest share of the total impacts, 83–85 % across the years, followed by bioenergy (9–10 % of total impacts), while other sectors show a limited contribution to the overall impacts. However, further developments are needed to improve the current coverage of some sectors, e.g. non-food agriculture, and bio-based chemicals, pharmaceutical, plastic and rubber sector. Potential monitoring indicators based on the Bioeconomy Footprint are proposed as basis for the EU Bioeconomy Monitoring System, including approaches from time trends to an absolute assessment against the planetary boundaries.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

We used the Nature Futures Framework to explore desirable futures for the high seas. Creative endeavours of co-production encourage imagination to address challenges.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"We find ourselves at a critical crossroads for the future governance of the high seas, but the perceived remoteness of the global ocean creates a psychological barrier for people to engage with it. Given challenges of overexploitation, inequitable access and other sustainability and equity concerns, current ocean governance mechanisms are not fit-for-purpose. This decade offers opportunities for direct impact on ocean governance, however, triggering a global transformation on how we use and protect the half of our planet requires a concerted effort that is guided by shared values and principles across regions and sectors. The aim of the series of workshops outlined in this paper, was to undertake a futures thinking process that could use the Nature Futures Framework as a mechanism to bring more transformative energy into how humans conceptualise the high seas and therefore how we aim to govern the ocean. We found that engaging with the future through science fiction narratives allowed a more radical appreciation of what could be and infusing science with artistic elements can inspire audiences beyond academia. Thus, creative endeavours of co-production that promote and encourage imagination to address current challenges should be considered as important tools in the science-policy interface, also as a way to elicit empathetic responses.

Seasonal plankton dynamics in Kongsfjorden during two years of contrasting environmental conditions,/articles/seasonal-plankton-dynamics-kongsfjorden-during-two-years-contrasting-environmental,"Selective copepod grazing and water mass origin impacted spring bloom composition. Diatom bloom enhanced zooplankton recruitment and deep carbon export. Spring bloom composition impacted summer plankton community. Mixo- and heterotrophic protists dominated the nutrient-poor summer months. Copepod grazers controlled the summer protist community.
",Goal 14: Life below water; Goal 13: Climate action,"Seasonal plankton time-series data are presented from Kongsfjorden from two years with contrasting environmental conditions. Kongsfjorden (west coast of Spitsbergen – 79°N) integrates inputs from Atlantic and Arctic waters, and glacier run-off, and is thus a prime location to study impacts on ecosystem dynamics of key environmental drivers that are relevant across the Arctic. Despite extensive research in Kongsfjorden, seasonally-resolved data are scarce. From late April/early May to early September 2019 and 2020, we conducted pelagic sampling at a mid-fjord station at mostly weekly to bi-weekly resolution investigating the environmental drivers of phyto- and zooplankton community composition and phenology. During spring 2019, Atlantic water masses with temperatures > 1 °C were found throughout the upper 250 m of the water column, and little sea ice occurred in the fjord. Spring 2020, in turn, was characterized by the presence of local water masses with sub-zero temperatures and relatively extensive sea-ice cover. The most striking contrast between the two years was the difference in phytoplankton spring bloom composition. In 2019, the spring bloom was dominated by the colonial stage of the haptophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii and diatoms played a minor role, while the spring bloom in 2020 was dominated by diatoms of the genus Thalassiosira succeeded by P. pouchetii. Selective grazing by large copepods and water mass structure seem to have been the decisive factors explaining the marked difference in diatom spring bloom biomass between the years while similar spring abundances of P. pouchetii in both years indicated that this species was less impacted by those factors. Our data suggest that differences in spring bloom composition impacted trophic transfer and carbon export. Recruitment of the dominant copepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis, Cirripedia and euphausiid larvae as well as the export of carbon to the seabed was more efficient during the diatom-dominated compared to the P. pouchetii–dominated spring bloom. In summer, the plankton composition shifted towards a flagellate-dominated community characterized by mixo- and heterotrophic taxa adapted to a lower nutrient regime and strong top-down control by copepod grazers. However, residual silicic acid after the P. pouchetii–dominated spring bloom fueled a late summer diatom bloom in 2019. Our data provide a first glimpse into the environmental drivers of plankton phenology and underline that high-resolution monitoring over many annual cycles is required to resolve the ephemeral variations of plankton populations against the backdrop of climate change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Analysis of the P. lividus sea urchin genome highlights contrasting trends of genomic and regulatory evolution in deuterostomes,/articles/analysis-p-lividus-sea-urchin-genome-highlights-contrasting-trends-genomic-and-regulatory,"Sea urchins are one of the most amenable model systems in developmental biology and they have enabled major discoveries. In this study, the authors investigated how conserved the genomic and regulatory architecture is between P. lividus, other sea urchins, and chordates. By integrating genomic and regulatory datasets, they demonstrated how regulatory changes could be associated with the origin of the novel body plan of urchins and other echinoderms.
",Goal 14: Life below water,"Sea urchins are emblematic models in developmental biology and display several characteristics that set them apart from other deuterostomes. To uncover the genomic cues that may underlie these specificities, we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and an extensive gene expression and epigenetic profiles of its embryonic development. We found that, unlike vertebrates, sea urchins retained ancestral chromosomal linkages but underwent very fast intrachromosomal gene order mixing. We identified a burst of gene duplication in the echinoid lineage and showed that some of these expanded genes have been recruited in novel structures (water vascular system, Aristotle's lantern, and skeletogenic micromere lineage). Finally, we identified gene-regulatory modules conserved between sea urchins and chordates.

Such studies remind us that Life on Land as we know it currently will only be possible through conservation of natural ecosystems.",Goal 15: Life on land,"Understanding how tree individuals allocate nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) between storage and growth is key to reveal the mechanism of alpine treeline formation as well as its response to climate warming. Yet, little is known about whether carbon allocation of treeline trees responds to temperature change by means of phenotypic plasticity and/or ecotypic adaptation. Here, we employed a reciprocal transplant experiment and a growth chamber warming treatment to explore the effects of temperature change on functional traits and carbon allocation between NSC storage and growth in treeline species Larix chinensis. In the reciprocal transplant experiment, we observed that the individuals grown at high elevation always displayed relatively lower specific leaf area (SLA) than those grown at lower elevations irrespective of species provenance, demonstrating the phenotypic plasticity of functional traits in relation to elevation. Higher growth rate and late-season NSC concentration in the individuals at their provenance elevation than at the elevations away from home, indicated that trees were locally adapted to their home environments in terms of NSC storage and growth. Additionally, individuals from high-elevation provenance showed considerably less phenotypic plasticity in carbon allocation (i.e., the ratio of NSC storage to growth) in response to temperature change compared to those from low-elevation provenance. In the chamber experiment, warming greatly accelerated shoot growth but not accompanied by a down-regulation in NSC storage in cold-edge trees, resulting in a lower ratio of NSC storage to growth. It was noteworthy that there was a time lag in variations of carbon allocation, especially in variations of NSC storage when cold-edge trees were grown in warmed climates. Our findings demonstrate that the responses of NSC storage and growth to temperature change might be a combination of short-term plastic and long-term adaptive reactions, and suggest a limited response of cold-edge populations in carbon allocation to climate warming.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The review found a high prevalence of these infections in this patient population, showing the need for routine hepatitis testing at the point of diagnosis of tuberculosis.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: There is a substantial overlap in the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and tuberculosis (TB) due to overlapping risk factors. Testing for viral hepatitis is not widely recommended for patients with TB. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the global prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis infection among patients with TB. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, African Journals Online, LILACS, and country TB reports were searched for studies published between January 1st, 2011 and June 17th 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses for proportions were conducted to obtain pooled prevalences. The prevalence of chronic HBV/HCV infection among patients with TB was also compared to that in the general population. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021276468). Findings: This analysis included 127 studies (83 for both HBV and HCV, 28 for HBV only, and 25 for HCV only) and data from 94,936 patients. The global pooled seroprevalence was 5.8% (95% CI 5.0–6.8) for HBs-antigen and 10.3% (95% CI 8.4–12.3) for HCV-antibodies. Pooled prevalence was highest in the WHO African Region for HBV at 7.8% (95% CI 5.2–10.9) and in the WHO European Region at 17.5% (95% CI 12.2–23.5) for HCV. In studies among TB patients who inject drugs, HCV prevalence was 92.5% (95% CI 80.8–99.0). Pooled HCV-antibody seroprevalence among patients with TB was higher than in the general population in all six WHO regions while HBs-antigen seroprevalence was higher in 3/6 regions. Interpretation: This review highlights the syndemicity of chronic viral hepatitis and TB and suggests that routine testing for hepatitis upon TB diagnosis may be justified.

"Reasons for not commencing direct-acting antiviral treatment despite unrestricted access for individuals with HIV and hepatitis C virus: a multinational, prospective cohort study",/articles/reasons-not-commencing-direct-acting-antiviral-treatment-despite-unrestricted-access,"This Article supports SDG 3 by analysing several cohorts of people with HIV/HCV co-infection across 6 high-income countries, and identifying that a substantial proportion had not commenced direct-acting antiviral treatment for HCV infection despite unrestricted access. Factors associated with commencement or lack thereof are explored; for example, people with indicators of low engagement with HIV care (eg, not on antiretroviral therapy) were more likely not to have commenced HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment)
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Individuals with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) who remain untreated with direct-acting antivirals can contribute to HCV transmission and HCV-related mortality. We aimed to compare rates of uptake of direct-acting antivirals following unrestricted access to this treatment in high-income countries and examine factors associated with remaining untreated. Methods: This multinational, prospective cohort study used data from the International Collaboration on Hepatitis C Elimination in HIV Cohorts (InCHEHC). We analysed data from nine observational cohorts participating in the InCHEHC, including data from six high-income countries (Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland). We included individuals aged 18 years and older, with HIV and HCV (ie, HCV-RNA positive without evidence of spontaneous clearance) during unrestricted access to interferon-free direct-acting antiviral treatment in each country. We calculated the cumulative proportion of participants who remained untreated with direct-acting antivirals, with follow-up starting after the date of unrestricted access or cohort inclusion, whichever occurred most recently. Factors associated with the commencement rate of direct-acting antiviral treatment were assessed using competing-risks regression with the Fine-Gray method. Findings: The date of unrestricted access to direct-acting antiviral treatment for people with HIV ranged from Nov 1, 2014, in France to Nov 1, 2017, in Switzerland. We included 4552 individuals with HIV–HCV, mainly men who have sex with men (MSM; n=2156 [47%]) and people who inject or have injected drugs (n=1453 [32%]). 1365 (30%) of 4552 participants remained untreated with direct-acting antivirals. For individuals treated with direct-acting antivirals, median time from start of follow-up to treatment was 5 months (IQR 2–12). For individuals who were not treated with direct-acting antivirals, median follow-up was 22 months (8–30). Being linked to care in Australia, France, or the Netherlands, on antiretroviral therapy, having undetectable HIV RNA, and shorter duration since first positive HCV test were independently associated with higher commencement rate of direct-acting antiviral treatment. Compared with MSM, male heterosexuals and females with unknown or other routes of HIV transmission (ie, neither injection drug use nor heterosexual transmission) had lower rates of commencement. Interpretation: Despite unrestricted access, almost a third of individuals with HIV–HCV remained untreated with direct-acting antivirals during follow-up, with variation in commencement rate of HCV treatment between countries and key populations.

The specimens in these studies, ranging from plankton to vertebrates, were collected and archived between 1900 and 2019, and are dominated by specimens from marine ecosystems. All the specimens included in this review were preserved by freezing or in ethanol/formaldehyde except for specimens in one study that were preserved via cryomilling. Microfibers were the most common microplastics in the reviewed studies. We recommend more microplastic studies over a wider taxonomic range of species and across a longer span of years utilizing archival specimen collections around the world in order to establish reference points and develop temporal trends for microplastic pollution of the environment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, various methodologies and their limitations along with non-standardization make the comparison of information concerning their prevalence difficult. Such diversity in techniques greatly limits the interpretation of results. Herein, We extracted data from publications on PubMed and Embase database up to the year 2022 regarding sampling strategies, identification methods, and reporting data for M/NPs quantification. In this review, 5 major areas for measuring airborne M/NPs have been identified including pre-sampling/ sampling/ post-sampling/ analysis/ and contamination avoidance. There are many challenges specific to each of those sections that need to be resolved through further method development and harmonization. This review mainly focuses on the different methods for collecting atmospheric M/NPs and also the analytical tools which have been used for their identification. While passive sampling is the most user-friendly method, the most precise and reproducible approach for collecting plastic particles is an active method which is directly followed by visual counting as the most common physical analysis technique. Polymers collected using visual sorting are most frequently identified by spectroscopy (FTIR; Raman). However, destructive analytical techniques (thermal degradation) also provide precise chemical information. In all cases, the methods were screened for advantages, limitations, and fieldwork abilities.

Exploring microplastic pollution in a Mediterranean river: The role of introduced species as bioindicators,/articles/exploring-microplastic-pollution-mediterranean-river-role-introduced-species-bioindicators,Instresting paper on Mediterranean river microplastic pollution  ,Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 13: Climate action,"Studies of plastic contamination in freshwater ecosystems and their biota remain scarce, despite the fact that the vast majority of plastic waste initially passes through lotic ecosystems. Biomonitoring provides valuable information regarding plastic pollution and microplastic threats to biota and human health. The aim of this study was to explore the potential use of a non-indigenous fish species as a bioindicator of microplastic pollution in an Eastern Mediterranean River. Our study area is located in a heavily modified and vastly impacted urban river which flows through the largest part of the Metropolitan area of Athens, Greece. We used an introduced chub species (Squalius vardarensis) to assess microplastic ingestion in the river. The results indicated moderate occurrence and abundance of microplastics in the fish gastrointestinal tracts; one-third of specimens (35%) contained microplastics, although the average number of microplastics per specimen was relatively low (1.7 ± 0.2). Overall, the abundance of microplastics in the water confirmed the moderate level of microplastics contamination in our study area. The major polymer types of microplastics identified by FT-IR analysis were: polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypropylene (PP); reflecting the fragmentation of larger litter from industrial packaging and/or household goods. Surface runoff of the urban environment, via motorways and major road networks, could be the contributing factor to the reported microplastics. Our results suggest that generalist's non-indigenous species such as chubs could be used as bioindicators of microplastics in inland waters. Introduced fishes can be a feasible, nondestructive, and cost-effective option for the assessment of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, while freshwater chubs' high abundance and omnipresence in European rivers further serve this scope. However, it is worth noting that the suitability of any particular species as a bioindicator of microplastics may depend on a variety of factors, including their feeding behavior, habitat, and exposure to microplastics in their environment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 15: Life on land,"The East Anatolian Fault (EAF), Cyprus Arc and Dead Sea Fault (DSF) intersect at the Hatay Triple Junction (HTJ) in southern Turkey, which is a tectonically controversial zone among researchers. Although it is not as active as the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) or other segments on the EAF in terms of seismicity, the HTJ accumulates strain causing considerable seismic activity in the region. Prior to this study, the strain accumulations and kinematics of the HTJ have not been precisely investigated using such a dense GPS network comprising permanent GPS stations, Turkish National Fundamental GPS Network (TUTGA) and campaign sites. Here, the fault slip rates and locking depths were constrained in the vicinity of HTJ using a new velocity field and improved block modeling. As per the results of block modeling, the EAF and Karatas-Osmaniye Fault (KOF) are fully locked down to depths of 15 km and 7 km, respectively. Furthermore, the Karasu Fault (KF) has a fully locked seismogenic zone to 7 km depth with a similar slip distribution to the EAF. Our kinematic model suggests 9.2 mm/yr left-lateral strike-slip rate and 2.0–2.7 mm/yr thrust faulting slip rate at the southwest end of the EAF. The KF appears to have left-lateral strike-slip at the rates ranging 4.0–5.5 mm/yr, while contrarily it has no significant normal/reverse faulting component. In addition, the KOF accommodates left-lateral strike-slip of 3.3–4.5 mm/yr and extension with the rates of 1.8–2.7 mm/yr.

This study investigates the specific role of HEV superinfection in the long-term outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients with liver cirrhosis. Patients and methods: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted using clinical, laboratory, and survival data collected from patients suffering from hepatitis B cirrhosis with or without HEV superinfection. Disease progression and mortality rates were analyzed. Results: After a two-year follow-up, HEV superinfection was identified in 27 of 811 patients. The transplantation-free mortality was significantly increased (51.9% vs. 14.3%, p< 0.001) in HEV superinfection compared to that in hepatitis B cirrhosis patients without HEV superinfection. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that elderly people were independent host risk factors for hepatitis B cirrhosis patients with HEV superinfection before and after propensity score matching (PSM). Moreover, HEV superinfection was a risk factor for patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis with new acute decompensation (AD) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) during hospitalization.

SVR rates in patients with RASs were improved when elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment duration was extended from 12 to 16 weeks and administered concomitantly with ribavirin. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, observational analysis using electronic health record abstraction. Patients with HCV GT1a infection and RASs at positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 who were prescribed 16 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir and ≥ 1 prescription for ribavirin were included.

"Optimal utilization of groundwater resources and artificial recharge system of Shahriar plain aquifer, Iran",/articles/optimal-utilization-groundwater-resources-and-artificial-recharge-system-shahriar-plain,The content concerns models for optimal utilization of groundwater resources,Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Developments in agriculture, industry, population growth and climate change lead to increased utilization of groundwater resources, followed by a decrease in groundwater level and an increase in the concentration of pollution in aquifers. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of optimal groundwater utilization and artificial recharge systems on groundwater level fluctuations and changes in pollution concentration of the Shahriar plain aquifer. Therefore, there was a need for a comprehensive multi-objective simulator-optimizer model that would be able to solve existing problem. For this purpose, a multi-objective modeling platform was developed that included two independent simulator-optimizer models. In the first model, the artificial neural network (ANN) was used to simulate the changes of groundwater level (GWL) and its quality as a function of the TDS index in the Shahriar Plain aquifer. The regression was then used to predict groundwater quality. Finally, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to optimize groundwater resources harvesting. The second model simulated the flood storage volume in the reservoirs of the artificial recharge system (ARS) using ANN and then optimized utilization of the artificial recharge system using (NSGA-II). The results of the first model showed that the optimal volume of water withdrawn from the aquifer and the optimal TDS value of the aquifer decreased by 29 and 18%, respectively, while the changes of the optimal groundwater level increased by 28 m. Furthermore, based on the second model results, the total volume of optimal recharge will increase by 119% in the studied period due to the artificial recharge system, followed by a 14% increase in the changes of the optimal groundwater level. Overall, it can be concluded that the multi-objective modeling platform method can meet the objectives of this research simultaneously.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Fountain scheduling strategies for improving water-use efficiency of artificial ice reservoirs (Ice stupas),/articles/fountain-scheduling-strategies-improving-water-use-efficiency-artificial-ice-reservoirs-ice,It discussed the fountain scheduling strategies for improving water-use efficiency ,Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs), also called ice stupas, are a climate-change adaptation strategy developed in the Indian Himalayas (Ladakh). With this technology, otherwise unused stream/spring water is stored in large ice towers during the winter. The surplus melt water generated in spring is used to satisfy irrigation water demands. Recent studies have shown that, during AIR construction, over 75% of the water sprayed is lost. In order to reduce these water losses, different fountain scheduling strategies implemented on two AIRs under identical weather conditions were compared. In one scheduling strategy, the fountain was operated manually (non-scheduled fountain) whereas in another it was operated via an automation system (scheduled fountain). The automation system computed recommended discharge rates using real-time meterological input and location metadata. Scheduled fountains produced similar ice volume while consuming one-tenth of the water the non-scheduled fountain used. Simulations converting non-scheduled fountains into scheduled fountains showed a threefold improvement in water-use efficiency. Overall, these results show that automated fountain water supply management can increase water-use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising their meltwater production.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This work reports the system optimisation of the management of these open-market food wastes for producing bioenergy and value-added materials and also evaluates the environmental impacts of the selected waste processing routes. It supports decision-making on the management of food waste in developing countries furthering SDG 7, 8 &13.",Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy; Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth; Goal 13: Climate action,"Though the magnitude of organic-rich agri-food waste arisings from open-air agri-food markets in many sub-Saharan Africa cities such as Kampala, Uganda are largely unknown, the predominant approaches to managing them, i.e., open burning and unsanitary landfilling, are unsustainable, emitting greenhouse gases, and represent an inefficient use of their intrinsic compositional and energy value. This study combined waste-to-energy (WtE) process modelling/simulation, material flow analysis and life cycle assessment to comparatively evaluate the bioenergy production, value-added material recycling opportunities and associated environmental impacts of characterised agri-food waste from three major open-air agri-food markets in Kampala City under three agri-food waste management scenarios: conventional landfilling, standalone (anaerobic digestion, AD) and integrated (hydrothermal carbonisation, HTC & anaerobic digestion; i.e., HTC-AD) technologies. Results reveal that an estimated 14.1 kt (eq. 34.8 TJ) of agri-food waste aggregated from the focus open-air markets is disposed of in an unsanitary landfill annually. Intrinsic agri-food waste compositional analyses evidence suitability for technology-based valorisation scenarios. Further, integrated HTC-AD performed better than standalone AD, marked by higher diversion of input agri-food waste from landfill (91% vs 75% for AD), recovery of diversified fuels (hydrochar and biogas) with higher energy efficiency (ηeff = 69% vs 45% for AD) and minimal environmental impacts. When benchmarked against landfilling, both technology-based valorisation scenarios significantly reduce (∼96%) adverse environmental responses for most life cycle analysis impact assessment categories. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of addressing the interlinked challenges of agri-food waste management and associated environmental pollution whilst promoting energy/value-added resource recovery from open-air agri-food markets. This is critical and timely to support near-term decision-making on selecting appropriate decentralised WtE technology-based agri-food waste valorisation systems that can realise economic, environmental, and technical (operational and strategic) goals in the city and other similar contexts.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With its 12, 000, 000 people daily generating 7800 tons of Municipal Solid waste, the city still struggles with basic services such as waste collection and sanitary landfill. This causes major social, environmental and health related issues. With the aim of contributing to the implementation of a better management system in Kinshasa, this study evaluates the environmental impact and the cost of the existing waste management framework and proposes 6 alternative scenarios. Each scenario attempts to optimize Greenhouse gas emissions and cost, using the Life Cycle Assessment approach. Results show that the current municipal solid waste management in Kinshasa city emits 640,673 tons of CO2 equivalent per year and costs a total of 17, 776, 169.78USD yearly. Focusing on increasing waste collection coverage and recycling activities in the proposed 6 scenarios, scenario 4 where all municipal solid waste is collected, produces 4,042,402 tons of CO2 equivalent per year and costs 143, 296, 983.4 yearly. In scenario 7, considered the most optimized management model for Kinshasa in this study, municipal solid waste is valorized through different treatment processes and atmospheric pollution reaches 2,835,491 tons of CO2 equivalent yearly, with a management cost of 152, 790, 779.4 USD/year. This study finds that the optimization of the Municipal Solid Waste management system in Kinshasa city causes the atmospheric pollution in terms of CO2 equivalent to decrease by half, when all waste is collected. Landfill diversion rate reaches up to 70%, but the overall MSW management cost increases by almost eight times as much as the current operational cost. The optimization of the management system is done by increasing waste collection coverage and implementing diverse streams of waste valorization. Despite the wide use of the Life Cycle Assessment method in waste management and decision making, this method has not yet been, to the best knowledge of the authors, applied in estimating Greenhouse gas emissions and cost of the Municipal Solid Waste in the specific context of Kinshasa city.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Impacts of solid fuel use versus smoking on life expectancy at age 30 years in the rural and urban Chinese population: a prospective cohort study,/articles/impacts-solid-fuel-use-versus-smoking-life-expectancy-age-30-years-rural-and-urban-chinese,This Article supports SDG 3 and 7 by highlighting that that household use of solid fuels for cooking or heating was associated with lower life expectancy in the Chinese population.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy,"Background: The impact of solid fuel use on life expectancy (LE) in less-developed countries remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the potential impact of household solid fuel use on LE in the rural and urban Chinese population, with the effect of smoking as a reference. Methods: We used data from China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) of 484,915 participants aged 30–79 free of coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer at baseline. Analyses were performed separately for solid fuel use for cooking, solid fuel use for heating, and smoking, with participants exposed to the other two sources excluded. Solid fuels refer to coal and wood, and clean fuels refer to electricity, gas, and central heating. We used a flexible parametric Royston-Parmar model to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause mortality and predict LE at age 30. Findings: Totally, 185,077, 95,228, and 230,995 participants were included in cooking-, heating-, and smoking-related analyses, respectively. During a median follow-up of approximately 12.1 years, 12,725, 7,531, and 18,878 deaths were recorded in the respective analysis. Compared with clean fuel users who reported cooking with ventilation, participants who used solid fuels with ventilation and without ventilation had a difference in LE (95% confidence interval [CI]) at age 30 of −1.72 (−2.88, −0.57) and −2.62 (−4.16, −1.05) years for men and −1.33 (−1.85, −0.81) and −1.35 (−2.02, −0.67) years for women, respectively. The difference in LE (95% CI) for heating was −2.23 (−3.51, −0.95) years for men and −1.28 (−2.08, −0.48) years for women. In rural men, the LE reduction (95% CI) related to solid fuel use for cooking (−2.55; −4.51, −0.58) or heating (−3.26; −6.09, 0.44) was more than that related to smoking (−1.71; −2.54, −0.89). Conversely, in urban men, the LE reduction (95% CI) related to smoking (−3.06; −3.56, −2.56) was more than that related to solid fuel use for cooking (−1.28; −2.61, 0.05) and heating (−1.90; −3.16, −0.65). Similar results were observed in women but with a smaller magnitude. Interpretation: In this Chinese population, the harm to LE from household use of solid fuels was greater than that from smoking in rural residents. Conversely, the negative impact of smoking was greater than solid fuel use in urban residents. Our findings highlight the complexity and diversity of the factors affecting LE in less-developed populations.

Triggering sustainable plastics consumption behavior: Identifying consumer profiles across Europe and designing strategies to engage them,/articles/triggering-sustainable-plastics-consumption-behavior-identifying-consumer-profiles-across,"This paper sought to explore similarities, variations and determinants of sustainable plastics consumption behavior within a sample of approximately 7600 respondents from eight European countries. We find that most consumers engage in sustainable plastics behavior during the usage phase, by reusing plastic containers and refilling water bottles. The regression analysis suggests that personal responsibility, having high values for nature, being a member of a nature organization and feeling knowledgeable about plastic pollution are important predictors of sustainable plastics consumption.","Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 15: Life on land; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure","The overproduction and consumption of plastics has led to a global challenge of plastic pollution and waste. Citizens in particular have an important role to play as they interact with plastics constantly in their daily lives as consumers, but different plastics consumer profiles are hardly understood, resulting in a lack of tailored and effective engagement strategies. This study identifies and analyzes sustainable plastics consumer profiles based on behavioral and psychological characteristics obtained through a large-scale survey deployed among 7600 respondents in eight European countries. The responses were subjected to regression modelling and a two-step cluster analysis. This study found personal responsibility and self-proclaimed knowledge to be critical variables affecting all stages of sustainable plastics consumption behavior (i.e. purchasing, using and disposing), as well as a factor differentiating consumer profiles. Concern and perceived consequences, on the other hand, are not found to be strong predictors of sustainable plastics consumption behavior. Four distinct social groups are identified and labeled as “Waste Warriors”, “Waste Conscious”, “Waste Moderate” and “Waste Laggards”. The results of the cluster analysis confirm that the citizen profiles are heterogeneous with large differences in behavior, attitudes, and perceptions related to plastics, indicating a need for differentiated engagement strategies. The results of this study enrich the literature on plastics sustainable consumption behavior and confirm the predicting power of various socio-demographic and psychological factors. In addition, the knowledge of the relative size, characteristics and unique needs of specific social groups related to plastics behavior are important for various stakeholders and key to develop suitable and effective marketing and policy plans to combat plastic pollution at a European scale.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The study demonstrates that rural farmers generally perceive CSA’s contribution to ‘food and nutrition security’ and ‘economic performance’ as more important than CSA’s contribution to ‘social equity’ and ‘environmental stewardship’. From a narrow perspective, the study demonstrates that farmers perceive CSA’s potential to ‘prevent pest and disease outbreaks’ and ‘increase human capital information’ as the most important contribution of CSA to SFS outcomes. In contrast, CSA’s potential to promote environmental stewardship is perceived as the least important among Ghana’s rural farmers. This enormity of displacement of smallholders’ perceptions at large is motivated by demographic, socioeconomic and ecological factors. Moreso, the CSA for SFS outcomes narratives is driven by farmers’ self-apprise, social networks and other local information dissemination agents. Furthermore, research findings suggest farmers’ awareness of CSA practices and interventions is deficient owing to unmet training and information needs for approximately 82% of the CSA practices and interventions. This situation elucidates the dichotomy of CSA practices’ narratives as tools for attaining food, nutrition security and economic performance to the detriment of critical issues such as increasing awareness and building farmers’ capacity to engage with CSA practices while also managing socio-ecological trade-offs that emerge over time due to engagement with CSA. Critical (re)orientation is needed across the scale to drive CSA practices and interventions that confine climate adaptation and food production practices within safe planetary boundaries without undermining social, economic, food and nutrition security needs.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Among the agroforestry saplings, Calliandra callothyrus (10.0 ± 0.7 ton/acre) had the highest aboveground biomass, while Markhamia lutea (4.3 ± 0.3 tons/acre) and Albizia chinense (4.1 ± 0.2 tons/acre) had the lowest aboveground biomass. Similarly, the aboveground carbon stock was the highest in Calliandra callothyrus strand (4.70 ± 0.1 tons/acre) and lowest in the Albizia chinense strand (1.94 ± 0.2 tons/acre). At a strand level, Calliandra callothyrus (17 ± 0.4 ton/acre) sequestrated the highest quantities of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, followed by Maesopsis eminii (10 ± 0.2 ton/acre) and Grevillea robusta (9 ± 0.5 ton/acre) species strands. Markhamia lutea (7 ± 0.2 ton/acre) and Albizia Chinense (7 ± 0.1 ton/acre) strands sequestrated the lowest quantities of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. At the age of 1.5 years, the grass species were fully grown but only stored 0.51 ± 0.0 and 0.47 ± 0.0 tons/acre of Aboveground carbon for Chloris gayana and Centrosema pubescens, respectively. The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions sequestrated by the grass: Chloris gayana (1.9 ± 0.0 ton/acre) and Centrosema pubescens (1.7 ± 0.0 ton/acre) were also less than that of the agroforestry saplings. From this study, the agroforestry species with higher wood biomass and fast growth rate are recommended for carbon dioxide emission sequestration.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Projecting climate change impacts from physics to fisheries: A view from three California Current fisheries,/articles/projecting-climate-change-impacts-physics-fisheries-view-three-california-current-fisheries,"This study shows downscaled climate projections that, without strong curbing of emissions, the California Current System (CCS) will undergo significant change this century, including 2–4 °C warming of sea surface temperature and an almost ubiquitous shift to novel conditions
",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"Motivated by a need for climate-informed living marine resource management, increased emphasis has been placed on regional end-to-end modeling frameworks designed to project climate impacts on marine ecosystems and evaluate the efficacy of potential management strategies under changing conditions. The ‘Future Seas’ project was initiated with a focus on three fisheries (Pacific sardine, swordfish, and albacore tuna) in the California Current System (CCS). This work leverages a suite of climate, ocean, ecosystem, and economic models to project physical, ecological, and socio-economic change, evaluate management strategies, and quantify uncertainty in model projections. Here we describe the components of the modeling framework, considerations underlying choices made in model development, engagement with stakeholders, and key physical, ecological, and socio-economic results to date, including projections to 2100. Our broad aims are to (i) synthesize a large body of climate and fisheries research that has been conducted, and continues, under the Future Seas umbrella, and (ii) provide insight and recommendations to those pursuing similar efforts for other applications and in other regions. In general, our results indicate that all three species will likely shift their distributions (predominantly poleward) in the future, which impacts accessibility to fishing fleets, spatial management, and quota allocation. For similar integrative climate-to-fisheries projections, we recommend attention is given to: recognizing potential biases arising from differences between the climate products used for ecological model fitting and those used for model projection; how sources of projection uncertainty are prioritized, incorporated, and communicated; and quantitatively linking scenarios – especially socio-economic scenarios – with climate and ecological projections.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The impact of climate change on the storm surges of the Mediterranean Sea: Coastal sea level responses to deep depression atmospheric systems,/articles/impact-climate-change-storm-surges-mediterranean-sea-coastal-sea-level-responses-deep,"This paper based on three implemented Regional Climate Models (RCMs), namely CMCC-CCLM, CNRM-ALADIN52, and GUF-CCLM-NEMO, for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of the 21st century. Atmospheric modelling datasets cover the Reference (1971–2000) and Future (2071–2100) Periods of climate projections. The results produced within this study can be used for investigations in specific locations of the Mediterranean basin within integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions during the 21st century. 
",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"This study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the Mediterranean, induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions. We try to add new insight in the long-term, climatic timescale, identification of affected parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems, indicative of the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century. To achieve this goal, an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established, green-house gasses emission/concentration scenarios (based on Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post-processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots. To this end, climate projections and outputs from three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative at the Mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re-analysis data. These atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model (MeCSS) for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics (sea level elevation and currents) thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide-gauges. Our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century, yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the Mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed. Moreover, a slight reduction of average storm-induced Mean Sea Level (MSL; component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation) is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century. Extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0.35 and 0.50 m in the Mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts (Venice lagoon, Gulf of Lions, northern Adriatic and Aegean Seas, etc.) and the Gulf of Gabes in its southern part. Overall, the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire Mediterranean coastal zone. Differentiations between the two scenarios (RCP4.5-8.5) used are obvious, not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima, which shows a very stable pattern, but more in terms of their magnitudes. Indicatively, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% can be observed towards the end of the 21st century, especially for RCP8.5-driven MeCSS simulations. This is a spatially averaged estimation, yet for some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain Italy, and France, such as Rovinj, Bakar, Toulon, Trieste, Ajaccio, Genova, Marseilles, Naples, Venice, Cagliari, Ancona, Ibixa, and Barcelona, the storm surge maxima might increase from 1% to 22% under different RCM/RCP combinations towards the end of the 21st century. Our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems’ effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100. The strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern Mediterranean coasts (Gulfs of Valencia and Lions, Ligurian and northern Adriatic Seas). They are followed by mid-latitude areas around Corsica, Sardinia, the mid-zonal Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Sea. The influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for Sicily, South Italy, Peloponnese, Crete, the southern Aegean archipelago, and Alboran Sea. The only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern Mediterranean littorals are the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These apply to the 20th century; however, they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations, with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts. A projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the Mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century, is likely the reason for the latter. The climate change signal (difference of Future–Reference Period) of the deep cyclones’ effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions, i.e., Sardinia, Corsica, the Ligurian and Adriatic Seas, and the entire Italian peninsula for all RCM-fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century. Conditionally, this is the case for the Gulf of Valencia, the north-western African coasts, the Alboran, Ionian, Aegean, and Libyan Sea coasts, under specific combinations of RCM/RCP forcings. On the other hand, a possible increase of the Mediterranean deep depressions’ influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the Gulf of Lions, the Ionian, Aegean and Levantine Sea basins, covering the north-central and north-eastern coasts of Africa. In general, a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid-to-high storm surge maxima (e.g., Aegean, Ionian, Gulf of Lions or Valencia or Gabes, etc.), but not the highest throughout the basin (e.g., Venice lagoon, Ligurian, Adriatic, etc.). In the latter coastal regions, however, intense local wind forcing mechanisms (i.e., Scirocco) are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges. The produced results can be used in focused studies for integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

However, the development of water consumption models is challenged by the rapid environmental and socio-economic changes, particularly during unforeseen events like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the efficiency of water demand prediction models, considering the lockdown measures and various exogenous features, such as previous consumption (PC) and socio-demographic (SDF), seasonal (SF), and climatic (CF) factors. Multiple ensemble models, gradient-boosting machines (GBM), extreme-gradient-boosting (XGB), light-gradient-boosting, random forest (RF), and stack regressor (STK) were examined, compared to other machine-learning techniques, multiple-linear regression (MLR), decision trees, and neural networks. The models were tested using 3-year metering records for 128,000 consumers in Dubai. The feature importance analysis indicated that PC and SDF had a significant impact on consumption rates with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.74, respectively, as opposed to SF and CF, which had negligible effect. The results showed that, before COVID, RF and STK outperformed other models with a coefficient-of-determination (R2) and root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.928 and 0.039, followed by XGB at 0.923 and 0.041, respectively. However, MLR achieved the highest prediction accuracy amid COVID with R2 and RMSE of 0.90 and 0.05, followed by GBM and XGB equally at 0.83 and 0.06, respectively. An ensemble-based error prediction model was applied, resulting in up to 9.2% improvement in predictions.

	altered during high volume periods which may stress resource availability.
	Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a four-hospital healthcare system. All patients with at least
	one ED visit containing imaging from 1/1/2016 to 9/30/2020 were included. Peak hours were defined as ED
	encounters occurring between 5 pm and midnight, while all other ED encounters were non-peak hours. Patient-

	Results: 321,786 total ED visits consisted of 102,560 during peak hours and 219,226 during non-peak hours.
	Black patients experienced longer image acquisition and image assessment times across both time periods (TR =

The combination model of ARIMA and BP neural network is used to predict the actual impact of epidemic situation on China's carbon emissions in 2020, and the spatial autocorrelation analysis method is used to analyze the spatial characteristics of China's provincial carbon emissions, which indicate that China's carbon emissions have consistently maintained a growth trend, from 2.05 billion tons in 2005 to 3.89 billion tons in 2019. Furthermore, the growth rate of carbon emissions and the changing trend of the emission intensity are the same, dropping from 12% in 2005 to 3% in 2019. The emission intensity also dropped from 1.1 in 2005 to 0.6 in 2019, indicating that the trend of increasing carbon emissions in northern provinces and Xinjiang changed significantly from 2005 to 2019. The overall carbon emissions of the 30 provinces in 2020 are predicted to be 4.068 billion tons, while the actual energy carbon emissions will be 3.921 billion tons, suggesting that the pandemic significantly reduced carbon emissions.

","Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure","The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with traditional healthcare systems has improved quality of healthcare services. However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed.

In this study, sampling at eight outlets was performed during a complete tidal cycle to estimate the MP flux to the Pearl River Estuarine (PRE) using a concurrent sampling strategy. The MP abundances ranged from 2.90 ± 0.57–5.9 ± 2.27 particles/L. A remarkable difference between tides in MP abundances suggests tidal effect should not be overlooked in assessment. The MP load through the eight outlets was estimated at 304 trillion particles or 1102 tons into the PRE annually.

In the current scenario, emphasis is given on electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce conventional energy demand and minimize greenhouse gasses. Most work has been done on solar-powered vehicles used for the transportation of people rather than agricultural transport such as labor, tools, and farm production. Therefore solar-powered farm rickshaw were tailored to Indian farm conditions. A three-wheel rear-driven 450-watt capacity solar-powered farm rickshaw was designed, developed, and evaluated in Indian climatic conditions. The developed rickshaw were comprised of three 150-watt polycrystalline solar modules. The produced electricity is stored in a 48-volt 30 Ah lithium-ion battery. A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) system was also incorporated to access the maximum power from solar panels. Statistical analysis was made with ANOVA tool and FCRD-test. The results were tested at the 5% significant level. The developed rickshaw has a cargo capacity of 300 kg and can be used to transport labor and farm produce. It reduces annual fossil fuel demand by approximately 350 liters and annual CO2 emissions by approximately 837 kg. The developed solar-powered farm rickshaw not only reduces fossil fuel demand but also reduces the emission of greenhouse gasses at large.

Understanding ecosystem services at the scale of landscapes benefits from careful consideration of transitions among these land uses, and this article examines these topics for landscapes in Peru and the Philippines.
",Goal 13: Climate action,"Forests in the humid tropics contribute to a wide range of globally demanded forest ecosystem services (FES) and are also beneficial to local communities, which are often highly dependent on natural resources. Approximately one-third of these forests are threatened by resource extraction, logging, and the expanding agricultural frontier. As a result of these developments, forest landscapes are shaped by a transition gradient representing areas with a high forest cover to locations resembling agricultural-forest mosaics. These transition gradients are often characterized by different types of forests and successional stages. We used inventory data from 331 plots collected in 24 landscapes in Ecuador and the Philippines, representing five forest-based land-use types. We used mixed linear effect models to analyze how the landscape transition gradient and forest type affect various forest ecosystem services.

Treatment as prevention effect of direct-acting antivirals on primary hepatitis C virus incidence: Findings from a multinational cohort between 2010 and 2019,/articles/treatment-prevention-effect-direct-acting-antivirals-primary-hepatitis-c-virus-incidence,"This Article supports SDG 3 by assessing the incidence of HCV infection among people with HIV, during different periods statified by level of access to direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV. Broader access to this treatment was associated, through a ""treatment as prevention"" effect, with lower incidence of HCV infection - approximately 50% lower in the period of broad access to the treatment compared with the period before access to the treatment.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Broad direct-acting antiviral (DAA) access may reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence through a “treatment as prevention” (TasP) effect. We assessed changes in primary HCV incidence following DAA access among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Methods: We used pooled individual-level data from six cohorts from the International Collaboration on Hepatitis C Elimination in HIV Cohorts (InCHEHC). Follow-up started from the first recorded negative HCV antibody test date and ended at last negative antibody test or estimated infection date. Follow-up was restricted to 2010–2019. We used segmented Poisson regression to model trends across pre-, limited- (i.e., restrictions on access) and broad-DAA access periods. Findings: Overall, 45,942 participants had at least one HCV antibody negative result and follow-up between 2010 and 2019. We observed 2042 incident HCV infections over 248,189 person-years (PY). Pooled incidence decreased from 0.91 per 100 PY in 2015 to 0.41 per 100 PY in 2019. Compared to the average pre-DAA period incidence (0.90 per 100 PY), average incidence was similar during the limited-DAA access period (Incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.98; 95%CI = 0.87, 1.11), and 52% lower during the broad-DAA access period (IRR = 0.48; 95%CI = 0.42, 0.52). The average annual decline in HCV incidence was 2% in the pre-DAA period; an additional 9% annual decline in incidence was observed during the limited-DAA access period (IRR = 0.91; 95%CI = 0.82, 1.00) and a further 20% decline in the broad-DAA access period (IRR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.73, 0.89). Interpretation: Our findings suggest that broad DAA access has a TasP effect on primary HCV incidence among PLHIV. Based on the initial years of DAA availability, the countries in the InCHEHC collaboration are on track to meet the World Health Organization's 80% HCV incidence reduction target for PLHIV by 2030.

Consequently, reducing emissions and improving environmental conditions are now a global priority for promoting sustainable growth and preventing the adverse consequences of global warming and climate change. However, there is a paucity of research employing econometric methodologies to investigate the potential of emission reduction factors, particularly in the case of the Philippines. Thus, the present study explored the dynamic effects of economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, and forest area in the Philippines in order to accomplish environmental sustainability by lowering CO2 emissions. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methodology were used to scrutinize time series yearly data from 1990 to 2020. According to the estimates, a 1% rise in economic growth, urbanization, industrialization, and tourism will raise CO2 emissions by 0.16%, 1.25%, 0.06%, and 0.02% in the Philippines, respectively. Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption, agricultural productivity, and forest area may result in CO2 emissions reductions of 1.50%, 0.20%, and 3.46%, respectively. Furthermore, the pairwise Granger causality test was employed to capture the causal relationships between the variables.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"At the 2015 World Health Assembly, UN member states adopted a resolution that committed to the development of national action plans (NAPs) for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The political determination to commit to NAPs and the availability of robust governance structures to assure sustainable translation of the identified NAP objectives from policy to practice remain major barriers to progress. Inter-country variability in economic and political resilience and resource constraints could be fundamental barriers to progressing AMR NAPs. Although there have been regional and global analyses of NAPs from a One Health and policy perspective, a global assessment of the NAP objectives targeting antimicrobial use in human populations is needed. In this Health Policy, we report a systematic evidence synthesis of existing NAPs that are aimed at tackling AMR in human populations. We find marked gaps and variability in maturity of NAP development and operationalisation across the domains of: (1) policy and strategic planning; (2) medicines management and prescribing systems; (3) technology for optimised antimicrobial prescribing; (4) context, culture, and behaviours; (5) operational delivery and monitoring; and (6) patient and public engagement and involvement. The gaps identified in these domains highlight opportunities to facilitate sustainable delivery and operationalisation of NAPs.

Calls to conserve PPE stocks and increase supply resulted in the rapid development of potential disinfection methods, with the possibility of improvements in medical waste reduction. However, how receptive health-care workers are to PPE reuse remains unknown. We aimed to examine the views of health-care workers who used PPE during the first COVID-19 wave in Aotearoa New Zealand, in relation to acceptability of PPE disinfection and reuse. Methods: In this multi-methods survey, health-care workers in New Zealand, were invited via a multimodal recruitment strategy to complete a survey regarding use of PPE during the first COVID-19 wave. Gender question options were male, female, gender diverse, or prefer not to say. Demographic differences in self-reported PPE reuse and acceptability were examined. The survey included closed (single-response, multi-response, ranking, and Likert-scale questions) and open-text questions. Any open-text comments were analysed with thematic analysis. The survey was built and deployed using Qualtrics software. Findings: 1411 health-care workers completed the survey between Oct 7 and Nov 30, 2020. 1397 participants had gender data available (1140 [82%] female and 257 [18%] male) and 995 (74%) of 1347 were of New Zealand European ethnicity. PPE reuse was common and reported by 628 (45%) of the 1411 participants, with 396 (63%) of the 628 reporting reusing PPE multiple times in 1 day. Acceptability of the concept of PPE disinfection for potential reuse was high overall (1196 [85%] of 1411) but varied depending on the type of PPE. Thematic analysis confirmed that PPE reuse was already occurring and respondents recognised the potential benefits of reduced medical wastage and increased PPE supply. Important caveats for consideration included the availability of scientific evidence, level of negotiated risk, and trust in the organisation undertaking PPE disinfection, with clear communication about decontamination processes being crucial to acceptability. Interpretation: PPE reuse occurred frequently during the first wave of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Although support for the disinfection of PPE for reuse was high, the success of any future programmes to reuse PPE will require meaningful engagement and clear communication with health-care workers. Further research into PPE disinfection safety and logistics is warranted, alongside the development of standard operating procedures and clearly communicated policies for the end user, should this more sustainable health-care practice be planned for adoption in certain settings.

We aimed to derive longitudinal wheeze phenotypes from birth to 5 years in a South African birth cohort and compare those with phenotypes derived from a UK cohort. Methods: We used data from the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), a longitudinal birth cohort study in a peri-urban area outside Cape Town, South Africa. Pregnant women (aged ≥18 years) were enrolled during their second trimester at two public health clinics. We followed up children from birth to 5 years to derive six multidimensional indicators of wheezing (including duration, temporal sequencing, persistence, and recurrence) and applied Partition Around Medoids clustering to derive wheeze phenotypes. We compared phenotypes with a UK cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]). We investigated associations of phenotypes with early-life exposures, including all-cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and virus-specific LRTI (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) up to age 5 years. We investigated the association of phenotypes with lung function at 6 weeks and 5 years. Findings: Between March 5, 2012, and March 31, 2015, we enrolled 1137 mothers and there were 1143 livebirths. Four wheeze phenotypes were identified among 950 children with complete data: never (480 children [50%]), early transient (215 children [23%]), late onset (104 children [11%]), and recurrent (151 children [16%]). Multivariate adjusted analysis indicated that LRTI and respiratory syncytial virus-LRTI, but not other respiratory viruses, were associated with increased risk of recurrent wheeze (odds ratio [OR] 2·79 [95% CI 2·05–3·81] for all LTRIs; OR 2·59 [1·30–5·15] for respiratory syncytial virus-LRTIs). Maternal smoking (1·88 [1·12–3·02]), higher socioeconomic status (2·46 [1·23–4·91]), intimate partner violence (2·01 [1·23-3·29]), and male sex (2·47 [1·50–4·04]) were also associated with recurrent wheeze. LRTI and respiratory syncytial virus-LRTI were also associated with early transient and late onset clusters. Wheezing illness architecture differed between DCHS and ALSPAC; children included in ALSPAC in the early transient cluster wheezed for a longer period before remission and late-onset wheezing started at an older age, and no persistent phenotype was identified in DCHS. At 5 years, airway resistance was higher in children with early or recurrent wheeze compared with children who had never wheezed. Airway resistance increased from 6 weeks to 5 years among children with recurrent wheeze. Interpretation: Effective strategies to reduce maternal smoking and psychosocial stressors and new preventive interventions for respiratory syncytial virus are urgently needed to optimise child health in LMICs.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Beneficiary and local stakeholder participation is an essential element to the success of community-based nutrition interventions. We sought to define active participation and review the available evidence on beneficiary and local stakeholder participation in community-based nutrition interventions in Africa. From reviewing the literature, we provide a reflective assessment on the process and findings. Participation falls on a continuum of community involvement from passive (no real involvement) to empowerment and community ownership (full active involvement). However, we found a clear gap in the research on defining active participation and identifying what constitutes active participation on behalf of beneficiaries and local stakeholders. However, progress was found; evidence included the use of participatory methods to engage beneficiaries and local stakeholders in the assessment and design phase. Beneficiary and local stakeholder participation in delivering interventions has moved forward with quantitative measures from process evaluation and implementation science. Research has started on the extent of beneficiary engagement (as recipients) and connecting this to outcomes. Evaluation has benefited from qualitative inquiry with insights from participants on engagement itself, and the barriers and facilitators to engagement.

This study aims to explore healthcare professionals' (HCPs) perspectives on PE and its application technique. A qualitative study was conducted in the chronic wards of a faith-based private hospital in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. Four focus group discussions among 46 HCPs, followed by 16 in-depth interviews, were carried out. Furthermore, the verbatim transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. The result showed four main themes, including PE as a strategy for achieving safe healthcare, factors affecting its implementation, the need for comprehensive strategies to engage the patients, and their roles in safety efforts. Furthermore, the implementation of PE can be enhanced by encouraging healthcare professionals (HCPs) to play proactive roles in empowering recipients. To achieve PE, “partnership culture” and the removal of potential barriers as well as determining factors, must be established. This requires a high-level commitment, organizational support with a top-down approach, and integration into healthcare systems. In conclusion, PE is essential for patient safety and can be enhanced by strengthening organization support, integrating into the healthcare system, improving HCPs’ roles, and empowering patients and caregivers to overcome potential barriers.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 13: Climate action,"An estimated half of the carbon fixed by trees is transported belowground, a portion of which is exuded into the soil where it fuels a complex belowground food web. The biological transformation of exudates into microbial metabolites and necromass is a major source of soil organic matter (SOM), including persistent mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Recent recognition of the fundamental importance of these inputs from living roots for sustaining life belowground and replenishing SOM demands a rethinking of how we harvest forests. By severing the lifeline of living roots, clearcut harvesting devastates much of the belowground biodiversity in forests, and prohibits a principal pathway through which SOM and C stocks are replenished. Retention harvesting retains the influence of living roots within retention patches and potentially throughout the harvested area, but only if inter-tree distances are 15 m or less. Retention trees sustain and support the re-establishment of belowground life and function following forest harvest and may mitigate post-harvest soil C losses.

Prelacteal feeds are strongly associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Self-reported insufficient milk continues to be one of the most common reasons for introducing commercial milk formula (CMF) and stopping breastfeeding. Parents and health professionals frequently misinterpret typical, unsettled baby behaviours as signs of milk insufficiency or inadequacy.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Financial toxicity describes the adverse impact patients experience from the monetary and time costs of cancer care. The financial burden patients experience comes from substantially increased out-of-pocket spending that often occurs concurrent with reduced income due to sick leave from work. Financial toxicity is common affecting approximately half of patients with a gynecological cancer depending on the validated instrument used for measurement. Financial toxicity is experienced by patients in three domains: economic hardship affecting patients' material conditions (i.e., medical debt), psychological response (i.e., distress), and health-related coping behaviors that patients adopt (i.e., foregoing care due to costs). Higher financial toxicity among cancer patients has been associated with decreased quality of life, impaired adherence to recommended care, and worse overall survival. In this review, we describe the current literature on financial toxicity, including how it can be assessed with validated tools, the downstream impact on patients, risk factors, and employment concerns of survivors. Whenever possible, we highlight data from research featuring patients with gynecologic cancer specifically. We also review studies with interventions aimed to mitigate financial toxicity and offer the reader real world examples of interventions currently being used.

",Goal 13: Climate action,"Crop rotation is an environmentally friendly and highly sustainable cultivation method. Fully understanding the effects of crop rotation on soil microorganisms will facilitate the incorporation of this method. Despite the increasing number of studies exploring the effects of crop rotation on soil microorganisms, there has not been a comprehensive review of the relationship between crop rotation and soil microorganisms. A meta-analysis was conducted on 76 studies that reported the effects of crop rotation on soil microbial indicators. The eight most commonly used indicators were selected to estimate the effect of crop rotation on soil microorganisms. In terms of soil microbial biomass, crop rotation significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) by 13.43 % and 15.84 % respectively, compared to those of continuous monoculture. A significant increase in the biomass of fungi was observed when other crops were introduced into continuous legume monoculture for rotation (45.50 %) and in regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) values were 600 to 1000 (15.72 %). In terms of soil bacterial diversity, rotation increased Shannon's diversity index by 7.68 % when compared with monoculture practices. The effect of crop rotation on soil phosphatase and β-glucosidase activity was not significant in this analysis. Moreover, the effect sizes of crop rotation varied by management practices, such as monoculture crop type or tillage practices. Notably, rotation effects on MBC and MBN were more pronounced under conditions such as reduced tillage, introducing other crops into cereal monoculture for rotation, rotation containing legumes, mean annual temperature (MAT) > 8 °C or MAP 600–1000 mm. However, the opposite was true for Shannon's diversity index, and the rotation effect was more significant when no tillage or conventional tillage was applied, MAT < 8 °C, or MAP<600 mm. In conclusion, crop rotation increased soil MBC, MBN, fungal biomass and bacterial Shannon's diversity index when properly used with other agricultural practices.

By combining measured faecal nutrient concentrations with the best available prey-consumption and prey-assimilation estimates, we calculated the expected contribution of minke whale faeces to nutrient pools in surface waters during summer.
",Goal 14: Life below water,"There is increasing interest in assessing the impact of whales on nutrient and carbon cycling in the ocean. By fertilising surface waters with nutrient-rich faeces, whales may stimulate primary production and thus carbon uptake, but robust assessments of such effects are lacking. Based on the analysis of faeces collected from minke whales (n = 31) off Svalbard, Norway, this study quantified the concentration of macro and micronutrients in whale faeces prior to their release in seawater. Concentrations of the macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in minke whale faeces were 50.1 ± 10.3 and 70.9 ± 12.1 g kg−1 dry weight, respectively, while the most important micronutrients were zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu). By combining measured faecal nutrient concentrations with estimated prey-consumption and prey-assimilation rates, we calculate that the current population of approximately 15, 000 individuals in the small management area (SMA) of Svalbard defecates daily 7 ± 1.4 tonnes (t) N and 10 ± 1.7 t P during summer. The molar ratio of N:P in minke whale faeces was 1.6:1, meaning that N was proportionally limiting, when compared to average elemental ratios of 16:1 in phytoplankton. In case of no N limitation in surface waters at that time, the release of elemental P through defecation in surface waters has the potential to stimulate 407 ± 70 t of carbon per day during summer as new or regenerated primary production in the SMA of Svalbard. This amounts to 0.2 to 4 % of daily net primary production in this region. This study provides the first assessment of nutrient concentration in whale faeces prior to their dissolution in sea water.

",Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities,"Urban areas generate high demand for urban areas to accommodate a broader range of functions associated with growth, given the rising rate of urbanization with more than two-thirds of the human population in 2050 projected to be city-dwellers. As a result, urban areas have been undergoing vigorous spatial, social, and ecological transitions. This generates a direct impact on nature, multiplicity, and the use of space. With the onset of drives focused on limiting the urbanization of space like “net zero land-take by 2050” by the European Union [11], it is evident that global authorities have realized the need to aid these spatial transitions. Such urban ecological transitions are primarily focused on territorial borders where sprawling infrastructure reservoirs and vital natural ecosystem services conflict. ‘Fallowscape’ has been seen as a tool to assist transition at peri-urban borders and form a link between brownfield and greenfield development. However, to justify the practice as a sustainable approach, there are various economic and social aspects to be accounted for, which influence the feasibility of fallow lands. Recent urban development projects (by the public as well as private sector) have seen a rise in the desirability of sustainable and ecologically sensitive approaches. Developers are keen on building dynamic environments that incorporate environmental transitions. However, with the perspective of profitability in mind, such projects often face challenges in authorization and execution. The research intends to introduce Fallowscapes as innovative practice for urban development projects, evaluating its position as a profit-driving tool by preparing an inventory of actors and ecologically sensitive parameters for urban development projects. The paper undertakes literature review of Fallowing as an ecologically sustainable practice, conducting empirical research by comparing case studies that implement Fallowscapes as an approach to market ecologically sensitive project visions.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Worldwide, approximately 24% of all adults smoke, but smoking is up to twice as prevalent in people with mental ill-health. There is growing evidence that smoking may be a causal risk factor in the development of mental illness, and that smoking cessation leads to improved mental health. Methods: In this scholarly review we have: (1) used a modern adaptation of the Bradford-Hill criteria to bolster the argument that smoking could cause mental ill-health and that smoking cessation could reverse these effects, and (2) by considering psychological, biological, and environmental factors, we have structured the evidence to-date into a stress-diathesis model. Results: Our model suggests that smoking is a psychobiological stressor, but that the magnitude of this effect is mediated and modulated by the individual's diathesis to develop mental ill-health and other vulnerability and protective factors. We explore biological mechanisms that underpin the model, such as tobacco induced damage to neurological systems and oxidative stress pathways. Furthermore, we discuss evidence indicating that it is likely that these systems repair after smoking cessation, leading to better mental health. Conclusion: Based on a large body of literature including experimental, observational, and novel causal inference studies, there is consistent evidence showing that smoking can negatively affect the brain and mental health, and that smoking cessation could reverse the mental ill-health caused by smoking. Our model suggests that smoking prevention and treatment strategies have a role in preventing and treating mental illness as well as physical illness.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Associations between sedentary behavior and negative emotions in adolescents during home confinement: Mediating role of social support and sleep quality,/articles/associations-between-sedentary-behavior-and-negative-emotions-adolescents-during-home,"The results of this research suggest that social support and sleep quality are important factors mediating the relationship between sedentary behavior and negative emotions in adolescents during a COVID-19-related home confinement in Shenzhen. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 4: Quality education,"Background: Prolonged periods of sedentary behaviour, for instance, engendered by home confinement in Shenzhen city, has led to negative mental health consequences, especially in adolescents. Previous research suggests, in general, that sedentary behavior can increase negative emotions. However, the specific mechanism driving the relationship between sedentary behavior and negative emotions is still relatively unclear. Social support and sleep quality might partly explain the effect of sedentary behavior on negative emotions. Thus, the current study aimed to examine the associations between sedentary behavior and negative emotions, and to investigate if social support and sleep quality mediate such a relationship. Method: During home confinement due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak, 1179 middle and high school students in Shenzhen were invited to voluntarily complete an e-questionnaire, including the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF), the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data from 1065 participants were included in the analysis. Results: We observed significant sex-related and demografic-related differences in emotional (e.g., anxiety, stress and social support) and other outcome variables (e.g., sitting duration and PSQI score). Furthermore, sedentary behavior, social support, and sleep quality were associated with negative emotions (p < .01), even after controlling for sex, age, only-child case, body mass index, and metabolic equivalent level. In addition, social support and sleep quality partially mediated the association between sedentary behavior and negative emotions. Conclusion: The findings of the current study suggest that social support and sleep quality partially mediate the relationship between sedentary behavior and negative emotions in middle and high school students during home confinement in Shenzhen city.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Grain quality was tested in japonica rice grown in open-top chambers after one generation (F1) under abrupt e[CO2] and after five generations (F5) under gradual e[CO2] and abrupt e[CO2]. Abrupt e[CO2] in F1 was ambient CO2 (a[CO2])+ 200 μmol mol−1 in 2020; gradual e[CO2] in F5 was a step of a[CO2]+ 40 μmol mol−1 per year until a[CO2]+ 200 μmol mol−1 from 2016 to 2020; abrupt e[CO2] in F5 maintained a[CO2]+ 200 μmol mol−1 from 2016 to 2020. Results showed that the response to abrupt e[CO2] in F1 was consistent with previous consensus with generally negative effects on grain quality, such as decreased protein, nitrogen, and amino acids as well as unchanged starch concentrations. In contrast, gradual e[CO2] in F5 did not affect these traits with only reduction in starch, while abrupt e[CO2] in F5 alleviated the deterioration of grain quality related with nitrogen. The current study suggests that multigenerational exposure to gradual e[CO2], actual case for crops in future climate, did not threaten human nutrition, but the amount of calories supplied by starch could be insufficient.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"The rising demand of ecosystem services, due to the increasing human population in coastal areas, and the subsequent need to secure healthy and sustainable seas constitute a major challenge for marine ecosystems management. In addition, global anthropogenic changes have transformed the marine realm, thereby challenging ecosystem health and the services necessary for human welfare. These changes have opened ecological space for opportunistic organisms, such as jellyfish, resulting in ecosystem-wide and economic implications that threaten marine ecosystem services. Here, we used a comprehensive dataset of jellyfish hazards over the period 1960–2019 to track their dynamics and implications for human welfare. Our results revealed that their large-scale patterns have been mainly enhanced in human-perturbed Large Marine Ecosystems, although the contribution of jellyfish Class to hazard type changed across ocean regions. The long-term variability of these events suggests that their temporal patterns mirror the pace of ocean warming and ocean health degradation nurtured by global anthropogenic changes in recent decades.

Also, the gradual warming of the earth has become one of the most important topics of discussion today. However, the trend of increasing unnecessary production, the volume of waste, and consequently environmental pollution and damage to plants and animals is very significant. One solution to prevent this trend is to use a sustainable supply chain and encourage producers to participate in green projects. But the other important thing is that attention to the environment should not deprive decision-makers of increasing profits and returns. Therefore, it is necessary to decide on the selling price of products according to issues such as inflation, transportation costs, production costs, and other items. After entering the production field, producers may need an initial budget to continue their work. This initial budget can be repaid with green bonds. Accordingly, a sustainable supply chain is introduced in this research, and then a two-stage model is presented. In the first stage, the model calculates the optimal priced of items for the manufacturer and retailer. In the second stage, it finances the introduced sustainable supply chain using green bonds. The Benders decomposition and Meta Heuristic algorithms are used to solve the problem and several numerical examples and test problems are provided to show the applicability of the model.

","Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities","The increasing worldwide population is leading to a continuous increase in energy and food demand. These increasing demands have led to fierce land-use conflicts as we need agricultural land for food production while striving towards renewable energy systems such as large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which also require in most of the cases agricultural flat land for implementation. It is therefore essential to identify the interrelationships between the food, and energy sectors and develop sustainable solutions to achieve global goals such as food and energy security. A technology that has shown promising potential in supporting food and energy security, as well as supporting water security, is agrivoltaic (AV) systems. This technology combines conventional farm activities with PV systems on the same land. Understanding the microclimatic conditions in an AV system is essential for an accurate assessment of crop yield potential as well as for the energy performance of the PV systems. Nevertheless, the complex mechanisms governing the microclimatic conditions under agrivoltaic systems represent an underdeveloped research area. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for a vertical AV system is developed and validated. The CFD model showed PV module temperature estimation errors in the order of 0–2 °C and ground temperature errors in the order of 0–1 °C.

Patients and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 323 known HBsAg positive individuals comprising 220 patients with CHB-related liver diseases [121 advanced liver diseases (hepatocellular carcinoma /HCC/ and non-HCC) and 99 chronic hepatitis (CH)], and 103 symptomless blood donors (BD) were enrolled. An ELISA kit was employed to determine HDV infection, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect HDV RNA. In addition, a non-coding genomic RNA region was sequenced for genotyping and phylogenetic analysis. Results: Irrespective of the stage of liver disease, the overall magnitude of HDV was 7.7% (25/323). The frequency of anti-HDV increases with the severity of liver disease, 1.9%, 4%, 10%, and 21.3% among BD, CH, non-HCC, and HCC patients, respectively. HDV RNA has been detected in 1.54 %(5/323) cases with a mean viral load of 4,010,360 IU/ml. All isolates were found to be HDV genotype 1. Conclusion: The magnitude of HDV infection increased with the severity of liver disease, indicating HDV infection is more common among patients with CHB-related liver diseases in Ethiopia.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Several other sectors may be difficult to decarbonize and a net-zero or net-negative carbon economy may require the deployment of geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. Utilizing CO2 as a working fluid for geothermal energy production and energy storage can achieve both goals: isolating CO2 from the atmosphere and providing valuable power system services to enable high penetrations of variable carbon-free electricity production. The use of CO2 as a working fluid facilitates access to low-grade heat in sedimentary basins, which are widely available and could allow for strategic citing near CO2 sources or where power system flexibility is needed. In this perspective piece, we summarize the state of knowledge for sedimentary basin CO2-geothermal, sometimes referred to as CO2 plume geothermal, and explore how it could support decarbonization of the energy sector. We also present the potential for using geologically stored CO2 for bulk energy storage which could provide valuable time-shifting and other services to the power grid.

Data were collected from 17 Swedish companies in the packaging, food, and retail sectors. The results of the study show a generally positive attitude towards the use of biobased plastics in food packaging among the interviewed companies. At the same time, the study identified the following barriers for an increased uptake of biobased plastics packaging in the sample: concerns about the potential conflict between food security and the cultivation of feedstock crops, technical performance issues, consumers' confusion, and doubts about the actual environmental benefits of biobased plastics. The key identified drivers for an increased use of biobased plastics packaging were lower material prices, increased technical performance and a greater supply.

EBS rely on soil biological functioning, where earthworms are essential by their contribution to ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and soil aggregation. Our aim was to assess the effect of EBS, compared to CS and undisturbed grasslands (GS), on earthworm communities and their contribution to the process of soil structure formation, evaluated through direct sorting and quantification of earthworm casts. EBS and GS had similar earthworm richness and abundance, in both cases significantly higher than in CS. Earthworm biomass was higher in GS than in both farming systems and higher in EBS than in CS. Cast production was higher in EBS compared to CS, and similar in EBS and GS. Cast production was linearly related to earthworm abundance and to a greater extent to earthworm biomass. We conclude, in the first direct assessment of earthworm contribution to soil structure formation in EBS of the Pampean region, that this farming system provides better conditions for earthworm development compared to CS, enhancing their role in the soil ecosystem processes.

Study Design: A survey was conducted of 3rd and 4th year medical students in 2019 at an US medical school in the Northeast. Results: One hundred and sixty-two students participated in the survey (response rate = 46 %, 162/353). Only 27 % reported receiving at least one educational lecture on abortion during medical school. Fifty-eight percent reported clinical exposure to surgical abortion. About 2/3 reported being somewhat likely to provide abortions in the future, despite most identifying as “pro-choice.” There was significant association between clinical exposure to surgical abortion and desire to include abortion in future practice (P = 0.03). The most common objections to performing future abortions were personal values, religious objection, and lack of training/experience. Most respondents did not feel comfortable providing counseling for abortion or adoption. Combined, only 14.4 % reported that they would be at least somewhat likely to apply to obstetrics-gynecology or family medicine residency programs, including programs with opportunities for such training. Conclusions: Earlier work has shown that medical student intentions to provide abortions prior to residency are better predictors of future abortion provision than during residency.

Relying on runoff from mountain watersheds, its water supply is obviously sensitive to precipitation, but so is its energy footprint. We analyzed Denver Water's annual energy use and water use alongside local precipitation over a 20-year period from 1995 to 2014. Energy use generally trended opposite to precipitation: In dry years the system used more energy than in wet years, even when the energy use was normalized by water volume. The data suggest that the system needs to compensate for less precipitation by expending more energy, presumably by supplying water from more distant or more energy-intensive water sources. A regression model indicates that a 1 cm decrease in annual precipitation equates to 275,000 kWh of additional energy use and that typical interannual variability in precipitation accounts for 11% of Denver Water's energy footprint.

","Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 5: Gender equality; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions","Background: Given slowing secular declines and persistent racial disparities, stillbirth remains a major health burden in the US. We investigate changes in stillbirth rates overall and for Black and White women, and determine how maternal age, delivery year (period), and birth year (cohort) have shaped trends. Methods: We designed a sequential time-series analysis utilising the 1980 to 2020 US vital records data of live births and stillbirths at ≥24 weeks gestation. Stillbirth rates overall and among Black and White women were examined. We undertook an age-period-cohort analysis to evaluate temporal changes in stillbirth trends. Findings: Of 157,192,032 live births and 710,832 stillbirths between 1980 and 2020, stillbirth rates per 1000 births declined from 10.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.5, 10.7) in 1980 to 5.8 (95% CI 5.7, 5.8) in 2020. Stillbirth rates declined from 9.2 to 5.0 per 1000 births among White women (rate ratio [RR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.53, 0.55), and from 17.4 to 10.1 per 1000 births among Black women (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.55, 0.59). Black women experienced persistent two-fold higher rates compared to White women (2.01, 95% CI 1.97, 2.05 in 2020). Stillbirth rates declined until 2005, increased from 2005 to the mid-2010s and plateaued thereafter. Strong cohort effects contributed to declining rates in earlier cohorts (1930–1955) and increasing rates among women born after 1980. Interpretation: Age, period, and birth cohorts greatly influenced US stillbirth rates over the last forty years. The decline in stillbirth rate was evident between 1980 and 2005, however subsequent declines have been minimal, reflecting no further gains for cohorts of women born in 1955–1980 and stagnation of period effects starting in 2005. A significant racial disparity persisted with a two-fold excess in stillbirth rates for Black compared to White women, underscoring the need for targeted health and social policies to address disparities.

Lasting impact of postnatal maternal separation on the developing BNST: lifelong socioemotional consequences,/articles/lasting-impact-postnatal-maternal-separation-developing-bnst-lifelong-socioemotional,"This article ties to SDG 3. This review highlights evidence that Maternal Separation (MS) interferes with neural development to permanently alter bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) circuitry, which may account for a variety of behavioral deficits seen following early life stress.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Nearly one percent of children in the US experience childhood neglect or abuse, which can incite lifelong emotional and behavioral disorders. Many studies investigating the neural underpinnings of maleffects inflicted by early life stress have largely focused on dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Newer veins of evidence suggest that exposure to early life stressors can interrupt neural development in extrahypothalamic areas as well, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). One widely used approach in this area is rodent maternal separation (MS), which typically consists of separating pups from the dam for extended periods of time, over several days during the first weeks of postnatal life – a time when pups are highly dependent on maternal care for survival. MS has been shown to incite myriad lasting effects not limited to increased anxiety-like behavior, hyper-responsiveness to stressors, and social behavior deficits. The behavioral effects of MS are widespread and thus unlikely to be limited to hypothalamic mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted the BNST as a critical arbiter of some of the consequences of MS, especially socioemotional behavioral deficits. The BNST is a well-documented modulator of anxiety, reward, and social behavior by way of its connections with hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic systems. Moreover, during the postnatal period when MS is typically administered, the BNST undergoes critical neural developmental events. This review highlights evidence that MS interferes with neural development to permanently alter BNST circuitry, which may account for a variety of behavioral deficits seen following early life stress.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"Atlantic leatherback turtles are faced with multiple threats, such as ship strikes, pollution and predation, throughout their annual migratory routes in the Northwest (NW) Atlantic. The risks associated with encounters with floating and submerged plastic debris are currently unknown. This study is a hazard assessment of plastics for this turtle's sub-population, using 2010–2019 data from the national Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup (GSCS) program, therefore potential exposure, and published evidence on the interactions of plastics and leatherbacks, hence potential effects. The type of plastic items and their abundance along shorelines of three Atlantic Provinces – Nova Scotia (NS), Prince Edward Island (PEI), Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) – were evaluated and compared to plastic items known to interact with leatherbacks. During the 2010–2019 period, a total of 220,590 plastic items were collected from 578 sites, representing 1264 km of shoreline. Plastic bags and rope are in the top ten most common items found on shorelines of NS, PEI, and NL. Pot gear and trap nets are in the top ten for PEI and are the 14th most common plastic item found on all shorelines. Cigarette debris is also commonly found. From the literature, plastic bags, pot gear and trap nets, and rope are known to adversely affect leatherbacks. Assuming that a large proportion of the shoreline debris comes in from the sea, after being in coastal waters for unknown periods, the study shows that such items pose a hazard to leatherbacks through ingestion and entanglement, based on published studies.

Eight compounds were found in seawater, and between nine to twelve compounds were quantified in marine invertebrates, sediment and seaweed. Diclofenac was the prevalent pharmaceutical with a maximum concentration of 2.86 ng/L in seawater, ≥110.9 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments and ≥67.47 ng/g dw in marine biotas. Among PFCs, perfluoroheptanoic acid was predominant in seawater (0.21–0.46 ng/L). Accumulation of perfluorodecanoic acid (764 ng/g dw) as well as perfluorononanoic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid (504.52 and 597.04 ng/g dw, respectively) was highest in samples of seaweed. The environmental risk assessment carried out in this study showed that although individual pollutants pose a low acute and chronic risk, yet individual compounds each had a high bioaccumulation factor in diverse marine species, and their combination as a complex mixture in marine organisms might have adverse effects upon aquatic organisms. Data revealed that this Atlantic Ocean marine protected environment is affected by the presence of numerous and diverse emerging contaminants that could only have originated from sewage discharges.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of Stage III-IV ovarian cancer patients who underwent surgery at a single academic, tertiary care hospital between 2012 and 2015. PC access was determined using a Health Resources and Services Administration designation. Outcomes included 30-day surgical and medical complications, extended hospital stay, ICU admission, hospital readmission, progression-free and overall survival. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analyses were used to analyze differences between patients from PC-shortage vs not PC-shortage areas. Results: Among 217 ovarian cancer patients, 54.4 % lived in PC-shortage areas. They were more likely to have Medicaid or no insurance and live in rural areas with higher poverty rates, significantly further from the treating cancer center and its affiliated hospital. Nevertheless, 49.2 % of patients from PC-shortage areas lived in urban communities. Residing in a PC-shortage area was not associated with increased surgical or medical complications, ICU admission, or hospital readmission, but was linked to more frequent prolonged hospitalization (26.3 % vs 14.1 %, p = 0.04). PC-shortage did not impact progression-free or overall survival.

In this study, we isolated HaASR2 from H. ammodendron and demonstrated its detailed molecular function for drought and salt stress tolerance. HaASR2 interacted with the HaNHX1 protein, and its expression was significantly up-regulated under osmotic stress. Overexpression of HaASR2 improved drought and salt tolerance by enhancing water use efficiency and photosynthetic capacity in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of HaASR2 maintained the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased sensitivity to exogenous ABA and endogenous ABA levels by down-regulating ABA biosynthesis genes under drought stress. Furthermore, a transcriptomic comparison between wild-type and HaASR2 transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that HaASR2 significantly induced the expression of 896 genes in roots and 406 genes in shoots under osmotic stress. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that those DEGs were mainly involved in ROS scavenging, metal ion homeostasis, response to hormone stimulus, etc. The results demonstrated that HaASR2 from the desert shrub, H. ammodendron, plays a critical role in plant adaptation to drought and salt stress and could be a promising gene for the genetic improvement of crop abiotic stress tolerance.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Nutrition research benefits from broad and intensive participation by stakeholders. The articles in this series demonstrate that understanding participation is complex because it incorporates the dimensions of stakeholders, activity, time, and intensity. Early involvement in research can help prioritize the problems to be addressed, refine the specific research question, and determine acceptable community-based approaches to be used in an intervention. The included studies examined the construct of participation and the diverse means by which it can be measured. They demonstrated how knowledge gained from early participation influenced the direction of interventions and increased relevancy for the community. The researchers assessed participation intensity during the intervention phase to help explain project outcomes and provide estimates of the magnitude of the effect that could be achieved if high-level participation of stakeholders was universal. In addition, participation in the analysis process was a key component of some of the articles in this series, demonstrating the richness of understanding that can be obtained through collaborative analyses. The included papers provide insight into how to define and measure participation, how to explore approaches to encourage participation of direct and indirect beneficiaries, and how participation at different time points and by different stakeholders can validate and support interventions and enhance effectiveness.

Inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation 4 (Id4) is an Id protein involved in the transcriptional control of many biological events, including differentiation. Studies of Id4-deficient mice revealed that Id4-deficient submandibular glands were smaller and exhibited accelerated differentiation, compared with those from wild-type littermates. In addition, dry mouth symptoms and Th17 expansion in splenocytes were also observed in the absence of Id4. Furthermore, Id4 levels in the salivary glands of patients with IgG4-RD, but not SS, were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy controls. miRNA-mRNA integrated analysis demonstrated that miR-486-5p was upregulated in IgG4-RD patients and that it might regulate Id4 in the lesion sites.

We assemble published evidence on the sub-daily associations of CVD and RD with ambient air pollution and temperature. Methods: Databases of PubMed and Web of Science were searched for original case-crossover and time-series designs of English articles examining the intra-day effects of ambient air pollution [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), ≤10 μm (PM10), 2.5–10μm (PM10-2.5), and < 7 μm (SPM), O3, SO2, NO2, CO, and NO] and temperatures (heat and cold) on cardiorespiratory diseases within 24 h after exposure in the general population by comparing with exposure at different exposure levels or periods. Meta-analyses were conducted to pool excess risks (ERs, absolute percentage increase in risk) of CVD and RD morbidities associated with an increase of 10 μg/m3 in particulate matters, 0.1 ppm in CO, and 10 ppb in other gaseous pollutants. Findings: Final analysis included thirty-three papers from North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. Meta-analysis found an increased risk of total CVD morbidity within 3 h after exposure to PM2.5 [ER%: 2.65% (95% CI: 1.00% to 4.34%)], PM10-2.5 [0.31% (0.02% to 0.59%)], O3 [1.42% (0.14% to 2.73%)], and CO [0.41% (0.01% to 0.81%)]. The risk of total RD morbidity elevated at lag 7–12 h after exposure to PM2.5 [0.69% (0.14% to 1.24%)] and PM10 [0.38% (0.02% to 0.73%)] and at lag 12–24 h after exposure to SO2 [2.68% (0.94% to 4.44%)]. Cause-specific CVD analysis observed an increased risk of myocardial infarction morbidity within 6 h after exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, and an increased risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest morbidity within 12 h after exposure to CO. Risk of total CVD also increased within 24 h after exposure to heat. Interpretation: This study supports a sudden risk increase of cardiorespiratory diseases within a few hours after exposure to air pollution or heat, and some acute and highly lethal diseases such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest could be affected within a shorter time.

This is often combined with the use of highly concentrated, expensive, and environmentally harmful chemicals. These sample preparation methods can be very time-consuming. Hence, with regard to green analytical chemistry, reduction of emissions and hazards, these sample preparation methods should be modified or avoided, and more environmentally friendly methods should be developed. The characterization and evaluation of the optimized hydrophobicity-water/air-based enrichment cell for microplastics (µSEP) are presented in this study. The separation mechanism of µSEP is based on the hydrophobic adhesion of microplastic on finely dispersed upstreaming air bubbles, serving as a sustainable and practical microplastic sample preparation method. The separation mechanism requires only water and air to considerably reduce the matrix for microplastic analysis. Using soil samples as an example, the applicability of the µSEP sample preparation method for the analysis of microplastics by Raman microspectroscopy (µRaman) and thermal extraction-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TED-GC–MS) is demonstrated. Within a sample preparation time of 60 min, for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), an average recovery of 77% ± 11%, for polystyrene (PS), 42% ± 11%, and for polypropylene (PP) 65% ± 12% was determined.

We observed the effects of MPs on seed germination and growth of amaranth, especially on the oxidative damage in amaranth roots. Impacts of MPs on the germination and growth of amaranth varied with the type, concentration, and particle size of MPs. PE MPs and PP MPs inhibited the shoot extension of amaranth, while the root length under PP MPs treatment was generally shorter than that under PS MPs and PE MPs. The accumulation of H2O2 in amaranth roots increased with the rising of MPs concentration. Compared with the control, a little number of dead cells were found in the roots of amaranth under high MPs treatment. It is noteworthy that only under 100 mg/L PP treatment, the amaranthus seedlings root cells were disorganized, due to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage in the roots. These findings provide essential information to assess the phytotoxicity of MPs in agricultural products, and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the observed phytotoxicity.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Travel speed and route choice through the lens of intersecting identities,/articles/gendered-travel-behaviour-micromobility-travel-speed-and-route-choice-through-lens,This Study supports SDG 5 and SDG 11 by discussing innovations in micro-mobility and their unequal impacts by gender.,Goal 5: Gender equality; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities,"Evidence shows that the use of micromobility vehicles is currently skewed towards young men, who are more likely to adopt risky behaviours, such as fast or aggressive riding. However, research on micromobility travel behaviour founded on GPS data has repeatedly failed to disaggregate findings by gender, or to account for intertwined sociodemographic identities. In this study, we investigate how bike-share cyclists and private e-scooter riders navigate through Barcelona's cycling facilities, and whether intersecting identities (in terms of gender, age and parenthood) influence their performance. Using 911 GPS-tracked trips of 89 participants, we build a multilevel linear mixed effects model that analyses the speed at which cyclists and e-scooter riders travel. The results show that the speed gender gap is particularly salient among e-scooter users, while being almost non-existent among cyclists. The model further indicates that cycling facilities influence riding speed, and that intersecting identities significantly explain how micromobility users circulate through the city. Drawing on theories of performativity and embodiment, we argue that findings pointing to gender differences in travel behaviour might be explained by women's unwillingness to negotiate traffic or tolerate harassment in highly masculinised spaces. These findings contribute to the limited available knowledge on the objective travel behaviour of micromobility users from a gender and intersectional perspective, i.e. recognising the complex way in which multiple forms of discrimination associated with identity combine. We also provide valuable insights into how the design of urban environments and targeted policies can have diverse effects on different micromobility users.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An online-based survey (n = 666, LimeSurvey -Portugal- and EyeQuestion -Norway-) composed of nine different sections, assessing acceptance of insects as food and feed, sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes towards edible insects and food choice motives was applied. Results showed that Norwegian consumers had a higher acceptance of insects as food or feed than Portuguese consumers did. It was also possible to divide consumers into four segments according to their acceptance level: Disgusted, Rejecters, Feed Acceptors and Acceptors. Considering the determinants of acceptance/rejection, disgust towards insects was the variable with the largest negative impact on either forms of entomophagy for both countries. On the other hand, consumers who seek new food experiences tend to have a higher acceptance of insects as food. Sociodemographic characteristics also influenced the acceptance of insects as food and feed, although differently for Norway and Portugal, while food choice motivations (convenience, health and ecological welfare) had minimal impact. These results highlight the importance of diminishing disgust reactions towards edible insects and to successfully marketing entomophagy to more neophilic consumers.

Against this backdrop, this study investigated consumer understanding and interpretation of CL status in PBMA, using plant-based burger recipes as case study. Eight plant-based burger recipes – systematically varying in main plant protein ingredient, recipe length, familiarity of ingredients, and clean-label status – were evaluated by consumers (N = 55) using projective mapping. The length of the ingredients list, together with the main ingredients was the primary aspect that caught the attention of the consumers. Consumers separated longer recipes – described as more complex, processed, unhealthy but also tasty – from shorter recipes – perceived as simpler and healthier, but less meat-like. Furthermore, a smaller part of the data was explained by the presence of chemical additives.

Adhering to these standards will help to avoid inherent biases that lead to insensitive content and misrepresentation, stigmatisation, and racial stereotyping.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Climate change reduces the conservation benefits of tropical coastal ecosystems,/articles/climate-change-reduces-conservation-benefits-tropical-coastal-ecosystems,"This article examines the extent to which Marine Protected Area can fit for purpose in Western Indian Ocean, in the context of global warming.
",Goal 14: Life below water; Goal 15: Life on land,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are among the most effective management responses to human environmental impacts. However, their capacity to sustain biodiversity and associated ecosystem services under climate change is uncertain. Understanding how climate shifts impact ecosystem functioning and socioeconomic well-being is vital for biodiversity conservation and adaptation planning. Here, we show that climate change could render the current MPAs network in 12 nations in the Western Indian Ocean ineffective in supporting conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Approximately half of the coral reefs and MPAs in countries most at risk of food insecurity will likely experience significant biodiversity losses. Only 4% of reefs and 6% of MPAs were located within areas less likely to experience climate shifts. Biodiversity hotspots for coral and reef fish were generally over-represented in the most at-risk areas.

Fears during the Covid-19 pandemics and their influence on physical health: A cross-sectional study on the general population in Spain,/articles/fears-during-covid-19-pandemics-and-their-influence-physical-health-cross-sectional-study,"The current study contributes to previous knowledge by clarifying how Covid-19 fears lead to somatic problems in the general population. Beyond direct relations, support a process where rumination mediates between fear and psychological distress, and psychological distress in turn leads to somatic problems. This process reveals a plausible mechanism in the somatization of health problems during the Covid-19 pandemic.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background/objective
	This study examines the paths through which Covid-19 can negatively impact health and lead to somatic symptoms. Based on the dual process theory, fears can impair health in two ways: through psychological distress, which is an automatic reaction to fear, and through a more conscious and deliberative rumination process.
	Method
	Data from a representative sample of the Spanish population (N = 3083 subjects,18 years or older) were obtained from a Survey by the Sociological Research Center (CIS). The dual path model was tested, and a longer sequence was included where the two mediators act sequentially to produce an impact on somatic symptoms.
	Results
	The results showed how Covid-19 fears translate into somatic problems. Beyond the direct relations, and after comparing with other possible alternative models, our findings support a process where rumination mediates between fears and psychological distress, and psychological distress in turn leads to somatic problems.
	Conclusions
	This process reveals a plausible mechanism that explains the somatization of health problems during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it provides theoretical and practical inputs to better understand the role of fears in health in crisis contexts.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Glucocorticoid-based pharmacotherapies preventing PTSD,/articles/glucocorticoid-based-pharmacotherapies-preventing-ptsd,"This article ties to SDG 3. The present work compiles the recent findings of glucocorticoid administration for the prevention of a PTSD phenotype, from human studies to animal models of PTSD. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly disabling psychiatric condition that may arise after exposure to acute and severe trauma. It is a highly prevalent mental disorder worldwide, and the current treatment options for these patients remain limited due to low effectiveness. The time window right after traumatic events provides clinicians with a unique opportunity for preventive interventions against potential deleterious alterations in brain function that lead to PTSD. Some studies pointed out that PTSD patients present an abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that may contribute to a vulnerability toward PTSD. Moreover, glucocorticoids have arisen as a promising option for preventing the disorder's development when administered in the aftermath of trauma. The present work compiles the recent findings of glucocorticoid administration for the prevention of a PTSD phenotype, from human studies to animal models of PTSD. Overall, glucocorticoid-based therapies for preventing PTSD demonstrated moderate evidence in terms of efficacy in both clinical and preclinical studies. Although clinical studies point out that glucocorticoids may not be effective for all patients' subpopulations, those with adequate traits might greatly benefit from them. Preclinical studies provide precise insight into the mechanisms mediating this preventive effect, showing glucocorticoid-based prevention to reduce long-lasting behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities caused by traumatic stress. However, further research is needed to delineate the precise mechanisms and the extent to which these interventions can translate into lower PTSD rates and morbidity.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Six freshwater ponds namely, Thuckalay pond, Eraniel pond, Pampanvilai pond, Villukuri pond, Erachakulam and Thottiyodu pond were selected from Kalkulam Taluk in Kanyakumari district. A total of 27 taxa of 17 genera were recorded from these freshwater ponds. Among the freshwater diatom species, Gomphonema montanum was found to be the predominant species in all stations except St- 2. The correlation analysis between diatom density and physico-chemical parameters revealed a significant positive correlation of diatoms (Nitzschia sp., Navicula sp., Cyclotella meneghiniana and Stauroneis sp) with nitrate, phosphate and lead at sampling statins St- 2 and 6. CCA analysis revealed that the concentration of calcium, chloride, pH, alkalinity, silica, and ammonia were found to favor the occurrence of dominant species such as Cymbella turgiduta, Gomphonema sp., Rhopalodia sp., in St-3 and St-4. Among all ponds, certain parameters like total alkalinity, nitrite, phosphate, sodium, cobalt, potassium perhaps reflect the influence of agricultural waste, sewage waste, or anthropogenic activities. The statistical indices in coherence with the dominance of pollution indicator species such as Nitzschia palea, Melosira granulata and Cyclotella meneghiniana revealed that the stations St-2, 4 and 6 were heavily polluted, whereas St- 1, 3 and 5 were less polluted.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to analyse health patterns in Indonesia at the provincial level between 1990 and 2019. Long-term analyses of disease burden provide insights on Indonesia's advance to universal health coverage and its ability to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Methods: We analysed GBD 2019 estimated cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, and risk factors for 286 causes of death, 369 causes of non-fatal health loss, and 87 risk factors by year, age, and sex for Indonesia and its 34 provinces from 1990 to 2019. To generate estimates for Indonesia at the national level, we used 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators, 317 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death, 689 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes, 250 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors, and 1641 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. For subnational estimates, we used the following source counts: 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators; 5848 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death; 1534 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes; 650 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors; and 16 016 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. We generated our GBD 2019 estimates for Indonesia by including 1 915 207 total source metadata rows, and we used 821 total citations. Findings: Life expectancy for males across Indonesia increased from 62·5 years (95% uncertainty interval 61·3–63·7) to 69·4 years (67·2–71·6) between 1990 and 2019, a positive change of 6·9 years. For females during the same period, life expectancy increased from 65·7 years (64·5–66·8) to 73·5 years (71·6–75·6), an increase of 7·8 years. There were large disparities in health outcomes among provinces. In 2019, Bali had the highest life expectancy at birth for males (74·4 years, 70·90–77·9) and North Kalimantan had the highest life expectancy at birth for females (77·7 years, 74·7–81·2), whereas Papua had the lowest life expectancy at birth for males (64·5 years, 60·9–68·2) and North Maluku had the lowest life expectancy at birth for females (64·0 years, 60·7–67·3). The difference in life expectancy for males between the highest-ranked and lowest-ranked provinces was 9·9 years and the difference in life expectacy for females between the highest-ranked and lowest-ranked provinces was 13·7 years. Age-standardised death, YLL, and YLD rates also varied widely among the provinces in 2019. High systolic blood pressure, tobacco, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high BMI were the five leading risks contributing to health loss measured as DALYs in 2019. Interpretation: Our findings highlight that Indonesia faces a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases that varies across provinces. From 1990 to 2019, Indonesia witnessed a decline in the infectious disease burden, although communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections have remained a main source of DALYs in Indonesia. During that same period, however, all-ages death and disability rates from non-communicable diseases and exposure to their risk factors accounted for larger shares of health loss. The differences in health outcomes between the highest-performing and lowest-performing provinces have also widened since 1990. Our findings support a comprehensive process to revisit current health policies, examine the root causes of variation in the burden of disease among provinces, and strengthen programmes and policies aimed at reducing disparities across the country.

The authors emphasise that identifying ethnic disparities is important to understand and prevent out of hospital cardiac arrests and to reduce inequalities.,"Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions","Background: Ethnicity might impact out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) risk, but it has scarcely been studied in Europe. We aimed to assess whether ethnicity influenced the risk of OHCA of cardiac cause in Danish immigrants and its interplay with risk factors for OHCA and socioeconomic status. Methods: This nationwide study included all immigrants between 18 and 80 years present in Denmark at some point between 2001 and 2020. Regions of origin were defined as Africa, Arabic countries, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Western countries. OHCAs with presumed cardiac cause were identified from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Findings: Overall, among 1,011,565 immigrants, a total of 1,801 (0.2%) OHCAs (median age 64 (Q1-Q3 53–72) years, 72% males) occurred. The age- and sex- standardized (reference: Western countries) incidence of OHCA (/1,00,000 person-years) was 34.6 (27.8–43.4) in African, 34.1 (30.4–38.4) in Arabic, 33.5 (29.3–38.2) in Asian, 35.6 (31.9–39.6) in Eastern European, and 16.2 (9.0–27.2) in Latin American immigrants. When selecting Western origin as a reference, and after adjusting on OHCA risk factors, Arabic (HR 1.18, 95%CI 1.04–1.35; P=0.01), Eastern European (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.13–1.46; P<0.001), and African origin (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.10–1.63; P<0.01) were associated with higher risk of OHCA, whereas Latin American origin (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.35–0.0.96; P=0.03) was associated with lower risk of OHCA. Comparable results were observed when adjusting on education level and economic status. Interpretation: This study emphasizes that ethnicity is associated with OHCA risk, even when considering traditional cardiac arrest risk factors.

We aimed to investigate gaps in coverage of key health outcomes and socioeconomic inequalities between Afrodescendants and non-Afrodescendants populations in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Methods: Using national household surveys (2011–2019) from ten countries, we analyzed absolute inequalities between Afrodescendants and a comparison group that includes non-Afrodescendants and non-Indigenous individuals (henceforth non-Afrodescendants) across 17 indicators in the continuum of reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health. These include indicators of family planning, antenatal care, delivery assistance, child nutrition, immunization coverage, child protection, access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene, adolescent fertility, and early childhood mortality. Inequalities between country-specific subgroups of Afrodescendants were also explored. The slope index of inequality was used to assess wealth-based inequalities within each ethnic group. Findings: Afrodescendants represented from 2·8% (Honduras) to 59·1% (Brazil) of the national samples. Of the 128 combinations of country and indicators with data, Afrodescendants fared worse in 78 (of which 33 were significant) and performed better in 50 (15 significant). More systematic disadvantages for Afrodescendants were found for demand for family planning satisfied, early marriage, and household handwashing and sanitation facilities. In contrast, Afrodescendants tended to present lower c-section rates and lower stunting prevalence. Honduras was the only country where Afrodescendants performed better than non-Afrodescendants in several indicators. Wealth gaps among Afrodescendants were wider than those observed for non-Afrodescendants for most indicators and across all countries. Interpretation: Gaps in health outcomes between Afrodescendants and non-Afrodescendants were observed in most countries, with more frequent disadvantages for the former although, in many cases, the gaps were reversed. Wealth inequalities within Afrodescendants tended to be wider than for non-Afrodescendants.

This paper  evaluates grain yield and nutritional qualities of a range of genotypes in an African crop plant.",Goal 2: Zero hunger,"Correlations and path coefficient analysis provide knowledge on trait interrelationships and potential for simultaneous, direct, or indirect selection in plant breeding. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic and phenotypic correlations as well as the path coefficient analysis among grain yield components and nutritional quality traits in cowpea genotypes. Data for grain yield components and mineral elements were collected from 70 cowpea genotypes planted at two environments in 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons in South Africa. Grain yield had significant (P<0.05) positive phenotypic correlations with number of seeds per pod (SPP), indicating that selection of cowpea genotypes based on SPP could be effective in maximizing grain yield. The heat map showed that grain yield was strongly associated with number of branches (NB), SPP and number of pods per plant. Among the yield components, only SPP showed significant (P<0.05) positive phenotypic correlations with Zn, Mn, and Mg. Grain yield showed no genetic correlations with yield components and nutritional quality traits. Significant (P<0.05) positive genetic correlations were observed between yield components and most of the nutritional quality traits, indicating inherent association among the traits. Path coefficient analysis identified SPP and NB as major contributors to grain yield. The PCA identified cowpea genotypes such as ARC030, ARC011, ARC016, ARC024, NGOII, ARC032, IT90K59, and ARC047 with high grain yield and good nutritional quality traits that can be used further as potential parents for crop improvement through biofortification.

"Socioeconomic inequalities in the 90–90–90 target, among people living with HIV in 12 sub-Saharan African countries — Implications for achieving the 95–95–95 target — Analysis of population-based surveys",/articles/socioeconomic-inequalities-90%E2%80%9390%E2%80%9390-target-among-people-living-hiv-12-sub-saharan-african,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 10 by examining socioeconomic inequalities in the 90−90−90 target that affect access to testing and treatment among men, women, and adolescents living with HIV, calling for governments to scale up equitable 95−95−95 target interventions prioritising the reduction of inequalities related to age, rural-urban residence, education, and wealth.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Inequalities undermine efforts to end AIDS by 2030. We examined socioeconomic inequalities in the 90–90–90 target among people living with HIV (PLHIV) —men (MLHIV), women (WLHIV) and adolescents (ALHIV). Methods: We analysed the available Population HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) survey data for each of the 12 sub-Saharan African countries, collected between 2015 and 2018 to estimate the attainment of each step of the 90–90–90 target by wealth quintiles. We constructed concentration curves, computed concentration indices (CIX) —a negative (positive) CIX indicated pro-poor (pro-rich) inequalities— and identified factors associated with, and contributing to inequality. Findings: Socioeconomic inequalities in achieving the 90–90–90 target components among PLHIV were noted in 11 of the 12 countries surveyed: not in Rwanda. Awareness of HIV positive status was pro-rich in 5/12 countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Zambia) ranging from CIX=0·085 (p< 0·05) in Tanzania for PLHIV, to CIX = 0·378 (p<0·1) in Côte d'Ivoire for ALHIV. It was pro-poor in 5/12 countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Malawi, Namibia and Eswatini), ranging from CIX = -0·076 (p<0·05) for PLHIV in Eswatini, and CIX = -0·192 (p<0·05) for WLHIV in Ethiopia. Inequalities in accessing ART were pro-rich in 5/12 countries (Cameroun, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi and Zambia) ranging from CIX=0·101 (p<0·05) among PLHIV in Zambia to CIX=0·774 (p<0·1) among ALHIV in Cameroun and pro-poor in 4/12 countries (Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini), ranging from CIX = -0·072 (p<0·1) among PLHIV in Zimbabwe to CIX = -0·203 (p<0·05) among WLHIV in Tanzania. Inequalities in HIV viral load suppression were pro-rich in 3/12 countries (Ethiopia, Uganda, and Lesotho), ranging from CIX = 0·089 (p< 0·1) among PLHIV in Uganda to CIX = 0·275 (p<0·01) among WLHIV in Ethiopia. Three countries (Tanzania CIX = 0·069 (p< 0·5), Uganda CIX = 0·077 (p< 0·1), and Zambia CIX = 0·116 (p< 0·1)) reported pro-rich and three countries (Côte d'Ivoire CIX = -0·125 (p< 0·1), Namibia CIX = -0·076 (p< 0·05), and Eswatini CIX = -0·050 (p< 0·05) pro-poor inequalities for the cumulative CIX for HIV viral load suppression. The decomposition analysis showed that age, rural-urban residence, education, and wealth were associated with and contributed the most to inequalities observed in achieving the 90–90–90 target. Interpretation: Some PLHIV in 11 of 12 countries were not receiving life-saving HIV testing, treatment, or achieving HIV viral load suppression due to socioeconomic inequalities. Socioeconomic factors were associated with and explained the inequalities observed in the 90–90–90 target among PLHIV. Governments should scale up equitable 95–95–95 target interventions, prioritizing the reduction of age, rural-urban, education and wealth-related inequalities.

The authors suggest that indiviudal-level measurements are needed to guide policy interventions that will serve those most in need.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: We are facing a global water crisis. However, because most water indicators assess physical availability or infrastructure in aggregate, knowing which sociodemographic groups experience water insecurity is difficult. We aimed to assess the prevalence of water insecurity across low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and examine how it varies by sociodemographic characteristics and exposure to life disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic across and within countries. Methods: In this observational study, we used Individual Water Insecurity Experiences (IWISE) scale data from a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of individuals aged 15 years and older (defined as adults) in 31 LMICs. The IWISE scale range is 0–36, and water insecurity was defined as a score of 12 or higher. We used multivariable linear regression models to assess how individual-level experiences with water insecurity related to sociodemographic characteristics in each country, region, and the pooled sample. Findings: 45 555 individuals from 31 LMICs completed the IWISE module between Sept 4, 2020, and Feb 24, 2021, and were included in the 2020 Gallup World Poll (GWP) database; 45 365 individuals had sufficient data to estimate the prevalence of water insecurity. 42 918 individuals from 30 LMICs had sufficient data to assess sociodemographic characteristics associated with water insecurity, and 39 161 individuals in 29 countries had sufficient data to assess how IWISE scale scores covaried with life disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall prevalence of water insecurity in 2020 was 14·2%, ranging by region from 36·1% in the sub-Saharan Africa region to 9·1% in the Asia region, and by country from 63·9% in Cameroon to 3·6% in China. In the pooled model including sociodemographic and COVID-19 factors, difficulty getting by on household income (vs no difficulty getting by: β 2·76 [95% CI 2·45–3·07]), living in the outskirts of a city (vs living in a large city: 0·85 [0·29–1·41]), and being greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (vs not being affected: 2·36 [1·96–2·77]) were strongly associated with higher IWISE scores. In country and regional models, the sociodemographic factors most consistently associated with higher IWISE scores were difficulty getting by on household income and life disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the strength of these associations varied across countries and regions. Interpretation: Through extrapolation of these nationally representative data, we estimate that hundreds of millions of people had life-altering experiences with water insecurity globally in 2020, and that their sociodemographic characteristics vary by country and region. Additional individual-level measurements globally could help pinpoint the characteristics of those who are most water insecure, thereby guiding the development of context-specific policy and interventions that will best serve those most affected.

Objective: The aim of this systematic review is both to summarize findings regarding the prevalence of mental health disorders among unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) in European countries since the last available systematic review (October 2017), and to describe associated risk factors. Methods: Five databases were systematically searched for articles published between October 1, 2017 and May 1, 2022. Results: The findings from 23 studies conducted in 9 countries which examined 80,651 child and adolescent URM are explained. Afghanistan was the most common country of origin in the majority of studies and >75 % of the subjects were boys. Most of the studies (N = 13, 56.5 %) assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence. We found a high prevalence of mental health disorders among URM children and adolescents, which varied considerably between studies, ranging from 4.6 % to 43 % for (PTSD), 2.9 % to 61.6 % for depression, 32.6 % to 38.2 % for anxiety and 4 to14.3 % for behavioral problems. Two studies looking at suicide attempts and deaths, also observed higher rates in URM compared to the host population of the same age. The studies looking at mental health risk factors suggest that levels of social support in the host country, rearing environment, and other factors are associated with psychopathology. Moreover, a meta-analysis of four studies regarding PTSD in URM and accompanied refugee minors (ARM) showed a lower prevalence among ARM: -1.14 (95%CI:-1.56—0.72).

However, there are still uncertainties about the mitigation potentials that can be achieved by the different land-based systems and how they perform relative to each other. In this study, we use harmonized future land use datasets to identify global land areas dedicated to second generation bioenergy crop production in 2050 under different climate scenarios. We then assess the global climate change mitigation potentials of using biomass for producing bioethanol with (BECCS) or without carbon capture and storage, biochar, or a synthetic fuel (e-methanol). For the latter, the electricity required to produce hydrogen for e-methanol synthesis is sourced from either wind power or the projected average electricity mix in 2050. Mitigation potential from natural regrowth on the identified land is also quantified. For all the cases, we modelled emissions of greenhouse gases from the life-cycle stages and use parameterized models to estimate local biomass growth rates. The identified land areas range from 1.95 to 13.8 million hectares and can provide from 30 to 178 mega ton (Mt) dry biomass annually from dedicated crops. Climate change mitigation potentials range from 11 to 257 MtCO2-eq. yr−1, depending on technological option and land availability. The largest mitigation is delivered by BECCS, but e-methanol can achieve similar findings when hydrogen is sourced from wind power. If hydrogen is produced from grid electricity, e-methanol can result in net positive emissions. E-methanol can also deliver more final energy than bioethanol (4.04 vs. 1.27 EJ yr−1). Natural vegetation regrowth can generally achieve higher mitigation than bioethanol, but less than biochar. An optimal combination of BECCS and natural vegetation regrowth can achieve a larger mitigation, up to 281 MtCO2-eq. yr−1, indicating that integrated solutions can help to achieve successful land management strategies for climate change mitigation.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This injustice is present in many cities, and its origins are predominantly rooted in enduring procedural and recognitional injustices. The purpose of this research was to systematically investigate Urban Forest Management Plans (UFMPs) prepared by municipalities across the United States (107 total) for their mention and explanation of environmental justice themes relevant to urban forestry. UFMPs describe municipal urban tree-planting and stewardship goals as well as pathways for both implementation and monitoring. Using a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative content analysis and quantitative measurement, we interrogated UFMPs for reference to three specific environmental justice pillars: distribution, procedure, and recognition. Mentions and explanations of these concepts were identified and counted for all UFMPs. Summary counts were then investigated for association with a UFMP's publication year, its municipal population, and its racial composition. The frequency of reference to environmental justice themes was greater in UFMPs published more recently and whose authoring municipalities have a larger population. A positive association exists between the proportion of Black residents in a city with an UFMP and the frequency of identified distributional justice explanations. While a positive association with procedural justice mentions was found with the proportion of white residents in UFMP authoring cities, environmental justice, overall, is not a central theme across most UFMPs published to date. More generally, we discovered that where UFMPs referenced environmental justice concepts, it was often brief and lacking in substance; recognitional justice themes were absent in almost all documents. Improving environmental justice goals and implementation strategies in UFMPs that validate the perspectives and experiences of residents can strengthen accountability between urban foresters and the communities they serve.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Introduction and objectives: Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is a major cause of co-morbidity in people living with HIV (PLWHIV). The modes of HCV transmission in the local population of PLWHIV are still unclear. We conducted this study to identify risk factors for HCV transmission amongst PLWHIV in central Mexico. Material and methods: We enrolled HIV/HCV co-infected cases and HIV controls receiving care in two outpatient clinics in Mexico City. Structured questionnaires were applied, covering demographics, history of percutaneous exposures, sexual behaviors, self-reported STD and recreational drug use. The statistical analysis for between-group comparisons were multivariate logistic regression models to assess the risk factors associated with HCV co-infection. We limited the final analysis to men who have sex with men (MSM) to avoid confounders potentially related to HCV acquisition in other populations. Results: Three hundred and thirty-four MSM with HIV (175 with HCV co-infection and 159 without) were analysed. We did not identify percutaneous exposures as risk factors for HCV. Intravenous drug use (IVDU) occurred in two cases and one control case. Risk factors independently associated with acquiring HCV co-infection were: history of an ulcerative STD (aOR=2.65, 95%CI=1.44-4.88), a HCV positive partner (aOR=5.25, 95%CI=2.78-9.91), having practiced insertive fisting (aOR=2.62, 95%CI=1.01-6.90), and rectal administration of drugs during sex (aOR=2.46, 95%CI=1.25-4.84). Conclusions: Risky sexual behaviors and chemsex seem to be the main drivers of HIV/HCV co-infection amongst PLWHIV in Central Mexico. IVDU and percutaneous exposures have a minor role in the local HCV epidemic.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, viral hepatitis has been a problem in human society. Vitamins play a significant role in preventing the hepatocarcinoma and liver cirrhosis. In this report, we will first focus on the vitamin D function in the immune system reactions, and then investigate its role in the viral infections and the signaling pathway of hepatitis B virus. The existence of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 27B1 enzyme, which is involved in vitamin D synthesis in immune system cells, has drawn researchers ' attention to the field of immune system. Toll like receptor (TLR) play a significant role in the immune system, and are one of the primary receptors of the innate immune system. In addition, the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, such as Interferon γ (IFNγ) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is one of the key roles of T helper type 1 (Th1) cells; these cells can suppress two cited cytokines via vitamin D. In the chronic phase of hepatitis B, Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) cells have weaker performance than the acute phase of the disease. The association between vitamin D physiologies with viral infections is also confirmed by genetic studies, carried out on genetic variations of vitamin D receptor (VDR) R-encoding disease susceptibility gene.

A longitudinal study was performed investigating the evolution of the blood immune profile during and after chemotherapy in this population. Patients and Methods: The study included 39 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy group, CTG) and 32 patients receiving only hormone therapy (control group, CG). A 10-gene panel associated with immunosenescence was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before (T1), at 3 months (T2) and at 12 months (T3) after initiation of adjuvant therapy. Nutrition status was assessed by using a mini nutritional assessment scale. Linear mixed model analyses were performed for trajectory evolution, with or without adjusting for age, tumor stage, breast cancer phenotype, and/or corresponding baseline gene levels. Results: Six genes relating to T cell activation (CD28, CD27, CD86, LCK, GRAP, LRRN3), and two genes relating to oxidative stress (PRDX6, HMOX1) exhibited a significant group-by-time effect, even after adjusting covariates(p≤ 0.01).

While supporting previous findings of enriched European ancestry in ES patients, these results also suggest alternative hypotheses for the significant contribution of mitochondrial ancestry in ES patients, as well as the protective role of African ancestry.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
The impact of partner autonomy constraints on women's health-seeking across the maternal and newborn continuum of care,/articles/impact-partner-autonomy-constraints-womens-health-seeking-across-maternal-and-newborn,This Article supports SDG 3 and 5 by demonstrating the need to better understand the roles that male partners play in encouraging or discouraging care-seeking behaviours during pregnancy and the postpartum period.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 5: Gender equality,"Background: Gendered health inequities impede women's reproductive autonomy over the life course. Pregnancy is a critical time point for assessing inequities and partners are integral actors in the achievement or impediment of women's and children's health during this time. Methods: Among a nationally representative cohort of Ethiopian women 5–9 weeks postpartum with data collected from October 2019–September 2020, this study aimed to 1) understand the prevalence and interplay of partner-related autonomy constraints (intimate partner violence (IPV), reproductive coercion (RC), lack of encouragement from seeking antenatal care (ANC), and lack of encouragement from seeking postnatal care (PNC), and 2) examine the impact of autonomy constraints on the maternal and newborn health (MNH) continuum of care. Findings: Sixty percent of women experienced a partner-related autonomy constraint prior to or during pregnancy. Approximately 20% of women were not encouraged to seek antenatal care and postpartum care, respectively, whereas fewer women experienced IPV during pregnancy (12.3%) and RC (11.0%). Less than one in five women completed the MNH continuum of care. Lack of encouragement of ANC and PNC were associated with decreased care-seeking at every point across the MNH continuum of care. Lack of encouragement of ANC (aOR = 0.45; p = 0.05) and of PNC (aOR = 0.16; p < 0.001) were associated with reductions in completing the continuum. Interpretation: Partner engagement, interventions, and messaging are critical to enhance MNH care-seeking behaviors.

Pandemic preparedness and response: exploring the role of universal health coverage within the global health security architecture,/articles/pandemic-preparedness-and-response-exploring-role-universal-health-coverage-within-global,This Health Policy paper supports SDG 3 and 17 by highlighting major gaps in pandemic preparedness and response and identifying opportunities to reconceptualise health security by scaling up universal health coverage.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several international initiatives have been developed to strengthen and reform the global architecture for pandemic preparedness and response, including proposals for a pandemic treaty, a Pandemic Fund, and mechanisms for equitable access to medical countermeasures. These initiatives seek to make use of crucial lessons gleaned from the ongoing pandemic by addressing gaps in health security and traditional public health functions. However, there has been insufficient consideration of the vital role of universal health coverage in sustainably mitigating outbreaks, and the importance of robust primary health care in equitably and efficiently safeguarding communities from future health threats. The international community should not repeat the mistakes of past health security efforts that ultimately contributed to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and disproportionately affected vulnerable and marginalised populations, especially by overlooking the importance of coherent, multisectoral health systems. This Health Policy paper outlines major (although often neglected) gaps in pandemic preparedness and response, which are applicable to broader health emergency preparedness and response efforts, and identifies opportunities to reconceptualise health security by scaling up universal health coverage. We then offer a comprehensive set of recommendations to help inform the development of key pandemic preparedness and response proposals across three themes—governance, financing, and supporting initiatives. By identifying approaches that simultaneously strengthen health systems through global health security and universal health coverage, we aim to provide tangible solutions that equitably meet the needs of all communities while ensuring resilience to future pandemic threats.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Sex bias and omission exists in Batten disease research: Systematic review of the use of animal disease models,/articles/sex-bias-and-omission-exists-batten-disease-research-systematic-review-use-animal-disease,Batten Disease is a rare disease. This reviews highlights the existing sex bias and omissions in Batten Disease research.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 5: Gender equality,"Batten disease, also known as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), is a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders mainly affecting children. NCL are characterised by seizures, loss of vision, and progressive motor and cognitive decline, and are the most common form of childhood dementia. At least one type of Batten disease and three types of mouse disease models show sex differences in their severity and progression. Scientific research has a recognised prevalent omission of female animals when using model organisms for basic and preclinical research. Sex bias and omission in research using animal models of Batten disease may affect understanding and treatment development. We conducted a systematic review of research publications since the first identification of NCL genes in 1995, identifying those using animal models. We found that <10 % of these papers considered sex as a biological variable. There was consistent omission of female model organisms in studies. This varied over the period but is improving; one third of papers considered sex as a biological variable in the last decade, and there is a noticeable increase in the last 5 years. The wide-ranging reasons for this published sex bias are discussed, including misunderstanding regarding oestrogen, impact on sample size, and the underrepresentation of female scientists. Their implications for Batten disease and future research are considered. Recommendations going forward support requirements by funders for consideration of sex in all stages of experimental design and implementation, and a role for publishers, families and others with a particular interest in Batten disease.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Previous research has suggested that the supply of hip replacements in the NHS is governed by the inverse care law. We examine whether inequities in supply improved in England and Wales between 2006 and 2016. Methods: We compare levels of need and supply of NHS funded hip replacements to adults aged 50+ years, across quintiles of deprivation in England and Wales between 2006 and 2016. We use data from routine health records and a large longitudinal study and adjust for age and sex using general additive negative-binomial regression. Findings: The number of NHS-funded hip replacements per 100,000 population rose substantially from 272.6 and 266.7 in 2002, to 539.7 and 466.3 in 2018 in England and Wales respectively. Having adjusted for age and sex, people living in the most deprived quintile were 2.36 (95% CI, 1.69 to 3.29) times more likely to need a hip replacement in 2006 than those living in quintile 3, whereas those living in the least deprived quintile were 0.45 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.69) as likely. Despite this, people living in the most deprived quintile were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.83) times as likely in England and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.04) as likely in Wales to receive an NHS-funded hip replacement in 2006 than those living in quintile 3. We found no evidence that these substantial inequities had reduced between 2006 and 2016.

Improving Access to Eye Care: A Systematic Review of the Literature,/articles/improving-access-eye-care-systematic-review-literature,Developing a working and inclusive definition of access to eye care.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Purpose: The goals were to develop a working and inclusive definition of access to eye care, identify gaps in the current system that preclude access, and highlight recommendations that have been identified in prior studies. This manuscript serves as a narrative summary of the literature. Clinical Relevance: Health care disparities continue to plague the nation's well-being, and eye care is no exception. Inequities in eye care negatively affect disease processes (i.e., glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy), interventions (surgical treatment, prescription of glasses, referrals), and populations (gender, race and ethnicity, geography, age). Methods: A systematic review of the existing literature included all study designs, editorials, and opinion pieces and initially yielded nearly 2500 reports. To be included in full-text review, an article had to be US-based, be written in English, and address 1 or more of the key terms “barriers and facilitators to health care,” “access,” and “disparities in general and sub-specialty eye care.” Both patient and health care professional perspectives were included. One hundred ninety-six reports met the inclusion criteria. Results: Four key themes regarding access to eye care from both patient and eye care professional perspectives emerged in the literature: (1) barriers and facilitators to access, (2) utilization, (3) compliance and adherence, and (4) recommendations to improve access. Common barriers and facilitators included many factors identified as social determinants of health (i.e., transportation, insurance, language, education). Utilization of eye care was largely attributable to having coverage for eye care, recommendations from primary care professionals, and improved health status. Geographic proximity, age, and lack of transportation surfaced as factors for compliance and adherence. There were a variety of recommendations to improve access to eye care, including improving presence in community health clinics, reimbursement for physicians, and funding of community-based programs such as DRIVE and REACH. Conclusions: The eye care profession has abundant evidence of the disparities that continue to affect marginalized communities. Improving community-based programs and clinics, addressing social determinants of health, and acknowledging the effects of discrimination and bias on eye care serve as ways to improve equity in this field.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy; Goal 13: Climate action,"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have become the dominant approach for envisioning different mitigation scenarios. While they are not intended to deal with justice, IAM assumptions and structure have justice implications that have not been explicitly discussed or clearly elucidated in critical accounts of modelling practices. Given their key influence in policy decisions and the increasing imperative for just transitions and climate action, a more explicit consideration of the justice dimensions of IAM-derived mitigation pathways is necessary. This paper reviews existing critiques to IAMs through a three-dimensional justice lens to examine the extent to which justice concerns emerge or remain unnoticed in the literature. This review helps substantiate how disciplinary and geographical assumptions and norms shape policy choices. Focusing mostly on the role of technoeconomic framings and processes of model-based knowledge production, and drawing from critical justice theorists, such as Nancy Fraser, the article shows how dominant approaches to justice have overlooked questions of recognition and their subsuming distributional and participational concerns.

Ethnoracial inequalities and child mortality in Brazil: a nationwide longitudinal study of 19 million newborn babies,/articles/ethnoracial-inequalities-and-child-mortality-brazil-nationwide-longitudinal-study-19,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 10 by highlighting substantial ethnoracial inequalities in child mortality in Brazil, especially among the Indigenous and Black populations.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Racism is a social determinant of health inequities. In Brazil, racial injustices lead to poor outcomes in maternal and child health for Black and Indigenous populations, including greater risks of pregnancy-related complications; decreased access to antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care; and higher childhood mortality rates. In this study, we aimed to estimate inequalities in childhood mortality rates by maternal race and skin colour in a cohort of more than 19 million newborns in Brazil. Methods: We did a nationwide population-based, retrospective cohort study using linked data on all births and deaths in Brazil between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2018. The data consisted of livebirths followed up to age 5 years, death, or Dec 31, 2018. Data for livebirths were extracted from the National Information System for livebirths, SINASC, and for deaths from the Mortality Information System, SIM. The final sample consisted of complete data for all cases regarding maternal race and skin colour, and no inconsistencies were present between date of birth and death after linkage. We fitted Cox proportional hazard regression models to calculate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between maternal race and skin colour and all-cause and cause-specific younger than age 5 mortality rates, by age subgroups. We calculated the trend of HRs (and 95% CI) by time of observation (calendar year) to indicate trends in inequalities. Findings: From the 20 526 714 livebirths registered in SINASC between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2018, 238 436 were linked to death records identified from SIM. After linkage, 1 010 871 records were excluded due to missing data on maternal race or skin colour or inconsistent date of death. 19 515 843 livebirths were classified by mother's race, of which 224 213 died. Compared with children of White mothers, mortality risk for children younger than age 5 years was higher among children of Indigenous (HR 1·98 [95% CI 1·92–2·06]), Black (HR 1·39 [1·36–1·41]), and Brown or Mixed race (HR 1·19 [1·18–1·20]) mothers. The highest hazard ratios were observed during the post-neonatal period (Indigenous, HR 2·78 [95% CI 2·64–2·95], Black, HR 1·54 [1·48–1·59]), and Brown or Mixed race, HR 1·25 [1·23–1·27]) and between the ages of 1 year and 4 years (Indigenous, HR 3·82 [95% CI 3·52–4·15]), Black, HR 1·51 [1·42–1·60], and Brown or Mixed race, HR 1·30 [1·26–1·35]). Children of Indigenous (HR 16·39 [95% CI 12·88–20·85]), Black (HR 2·34 [1·78–3·06]), and Brown or Mixed race mothers (HR 2·05 [1·71–2·45]) had a higher risk of death from malnutrition than did children of White mothers. Similar patterns were observed for death from diarrhoea (Indigenous, HR 14·28 [95% CI 12·25–16·65]; Black, HR 1·72 [1·44–2·05]; and Brown or Mixed race mothers, HR 1·78 [1·61–1·98]) and influenza and pneumonia (Indigenous, HR 6·49 [95% CI 5·78–7·27]; Black, HR 1·78 [1·62–1·96]; and Brown or Mixed race mothers, HR 1·60 [1·51–1·69]). Interpretation: Substantial ethnoracial inequalities were observed in child mortality in Brazil, especially among the Indigenous and Black populations. These findings demonstrate the importance of regular racial inequality assessments and monitoring. We suggest implementing policies to promote ethnoracial equity to reduce the impact of racism on child health.

"Sustained detection of type 2 poliovirus in London sewage between February and July, 2022, by enhanced environmental surveillance",/articles/sustained-detection-type-2-poliovirus-london-sewage-between-february-and-july-2022-enhanced,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 6 by demonstrating that polio environmental surveillance by testing wastewater samples is a valuable tool for tracking the distribution of polio and non-polio enteroviruses, and could be instrumental for global poliovirus elimination efforts. 
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The international spread of poliovirus exposes all countries to the risk of outbreaks and is designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. This risk can be exacerbated in countries using inactivated polio vaccine, which offers excellent protection against paralysis but is less effective than oral vaccine against poliovirus shedding, potentially allowing circulation without detection of paralytic cases for long periods of time. Our study investigated the molecular properties of type 2 poliovirus isolates found in sewage with an aim to detect virus transmission in the community. Methods: We performed environmental surveillance in London, UK, testing sewage samples using WHO recommended methods that include concentration, virus isolation in cell culture, and molecular characterisation. We additionally implemented direct molecular detection and determined whole-genome sequences of every isolate using novel nanopore protocols. Findings: 118 genetically linked poliovirus isolates related to the serotype 2 Sabin vaccine strain were detected in 21 of 52 sequential sewage samples collected in London between Feb 8 and July 4, 2022. Expansion of environmental surveillance sites in London helped localise transmission to several boroughs in north and east London. All isolates have lost two key attenuating mutations, are recombinants with a species C enterovirus, and an increasing proportion (20 of 118) meet the criterion for a vaccine-derived poliovirus, having six to ten nucleotide changes in the gene coding for VP1 capsid protein. Interpretation: Environmental surveillance allowed early detection of poliovirus importation and circulation in London, permitting a rapid public health response, including enhanced surveillance and an inactivated polio vaccine campaign among children aged 1–9 years. Whole-genome sequences generated through nanopore sequencing established linkage of isolates and confirmed transmission of a unique recombinant poliovirus lineage that has now been detected in Israel and the USA.

Health-Related Quality of Life in Young Adult Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation,/articles/health-related-quality-life-young-adult-survivors-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation,"Young adult hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors have impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared with older adult survivors. Adolescents and YAs are at a developmental stage marked by rapid changes in cognitive, social, and emotional growth and historically have experienced a gap in services relating to their psychosocial needs. Findings confirm the hypothesis that self-efficacy would be pivotal to higher levels of mental function and lower distress.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Young adults (YA), age 18 to 39 years, are at a stage of life that may make them more vulnerable than older adults to impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during and after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Health self-efficacy (HSE), the belief that one can implement strategies to produce a desired health outcome, has been associated with health outcomes in oncology research. Little is known about HRQOL or HSE in YA HCT survivors compared with older HCT survivors. Given the age-specific psychosocial challenges facing YA HCT recipients and research on non-transplant YA cancer survivors, we hypothesized that YA survivors would have worse post-HCT HRQOL compared with older adults, and that among YA HCT survivors, higher levels of HSE would be associated with higher levels of HRQOL and lower levels of cancer-related distress. This was a cross-sectional secondary analysis of 2 combined baseline datasets from multicenter studies of HCT survivors approached for participation in clinical trials of survivorship interventions. Participants from 20 transplantation centers in the United States were at 1 to 10 years post-HCT and age ≥18 years at the time of study enrollment, had no evidence of disease relapse/progression or subsequent malignancies, and could read English adequately to consent for and complete assessments. Medical record and patient-reported data were obtained for demographics and HCT-related clinical factors and complications (eg, total body irradiation, chronic graft-versus-host disease [cGVHD]). Participants completed surveys on HRQOL, including the Short-Form [SF]-12, HSE, and Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD), which includes 6 subscales and reports an overall mean score. On the SF-12, both the Mental Component Score (MCS) and Physical Component Score (PCS) were calculated. Two cohorts were compared: YAs (age 18 to 39 years at transplantation) and older adults (age ≥40 years at transplantation). Multiple linear regression analyses identified factors associated with HSE, PCS, MCS, and CTXD in YAs. In this analysis of 979 survivors, compared with the older adults, the YA participants had lower median mental health scores (SF-12 MCS: 48.40 versus 50.23; P = .04) and higher cancer-related distress (CTXD:. 96 versus. 85; P = .04), but better physical health (SF-12 PCS: 48.99 versus 47.18; P = .049). Greater overall cancer-related distress was driven by higher levels of uncertainty, financial concern, and medical demand subscales for YAs compared with older adults. Young adults also had lower HSE (2.93 versus 3.08; P = .0004). In a multivariate model, HSE was strongly associated with age group (P = .0005) after adjusting for multiple other transplantation-related factors. Among YAs, HSE was associated with the SF-12 MCS and PCS and the CTXD, and HSE remained significant after adjusting for other transplantation-related factors. Overall, the YA HCT survivors had lower mental health, increased cancer-related distress, and lower levels of HSE compared with the older adults. Although the direction of these effects cannot be determined with these data, the strong association between HSE and HRQOL among YAs suggests that targeting interventions to improve HSE may have broad impact on health outcomes.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This research examined the mental health of a cohort of asylum-seeking children, adolescents and their primary caregiver affected by insecure residency while living in the community, compared to refugees and immigrants.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: This research examined the mental health of a cohort of asylum-seeking children, adolescents and their primary caregiver affected by insecure residency while living in the community, compared to refugees and immigrants. Methods: The project investigated the prevalence of psychosocial problems among Iranian and Afghani asylum seeker, refugee and immigrant children and adolescents, and their caregivers who arrived in Australia from 2010. In total, n=196 children and adolescents aged 5–18 years, and their primary caregiver were asked about family visa status, country of origin, level of education, parent symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire) and child wellbeing (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). An additional n=362 Farsi and Dari speaking children, recruited through the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) study, a national comparison sample of families with permanent refugee visas, were included. Findings: Asylum seeker children and adolescents displayed significantly more psychosocial problems compared to those with full refugee protection and immigrant background within the current sample and when benchmarked against a national sample of Farsi-Dari speaking refugee children. Higher parental posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was associated with poorer child and adolescent psychosocial functioning. This effect was more marked in families with insecure residency. Interpretation: Insecure visa status is associated with higher rates of children's mental health problems and a stronger association with parental PTSD symptoms compared to children with secure residency. This raises important questions about Australia's restrictive immigration policies.

However, this study finds that since 2011, crop irrigation is increasingly using water resources considered ""scarce"" which is not sustainable. 
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 2: Zero hunger,"Increasing agricultural water scarcity is threatening food security and ecosystem sustainability in China. Previous studies showed a deceleration in the growth of irrigation water use in China due to reducing water use intensities of irrigation. However, a finer-scale analysis at the prefecture level is urgently needed to account for the impacts of land management policies and the impact of international food trade in water stress mitigation. Here, we address these gaps and demonstrate that the scarce irrigation water use trend reversed to rising after 2011 through shifting to irrigated cropland, even if grain import reduced water stress at the national scale, and we highlight the specificity of relationships between scarce water use and irrigated cropland change at both the river-basin and prefecture scales.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of the coronavirus and the influence of the lockdown associated with rainfall on the water quality of the Capibaribe and Tejipió rivers, Recife, Northeast Brazil, using cloud remote sensing on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The study was carried out based on eight representative images from Sentinel-2. Among the selected images, two refer to the year 2019 (before the pandemic), three refer to 2020 (during a pandemic), two from the lockdown period (2020), and one for the year 2021. The land use and land cover (LULC) and slope of the study region were determined and classified. Water turbidity data were subjected to descriptive and multivariate statistics. When analyzing the data on LULC for the riparian margin of the Capibaribe and Tejipió rivers, a low permanent preservation area was found, with a predominance of almost 100% of the urban area to which the deposition of soil particles in rivers are minimal. The results indicated that turbidity values in the water bodies varied from 6 mg. L−1 up to 40 mg. L−1.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Central Chile has been affected by a sustained deficit in precipitation since 2010, the so-called mega drought, that has led to decreased water discharge in the fluvial basins of this region, affecting sediment fluxes. We investigate changes in sediment fluxes in the Itata River Basin (36-37°S, 11,326 km2) in central Chile over a period of 30 years (1986–2017) to evaluate the role of the mega drought in this region. We use a dataset of water discharge and suspended sediment concentration measured on a daily basis from a network of gauging stations that cover the basin from the mountain area to the river mouth. We estimated temporal variations in sediment fluxes within the basin. When comparing the pre-drought (1986–2009) and drought (2010–2017) periods, we found that annual sediment fluxes during the mega drought decreased between 28% and 67% from pre-drought values with variable intensity among the main tributaries. In addition, the season of maximum sediment transport in the basin has shifted from May–June to August during the mega drought along with a shift in the seasonality of maximum water discharge. We interpret that the precipitation deficit during the mega drought delays the recharge of the soil moisture and the establishment of favorable conditions to mobilize sediment in hillslopes. Because sediment transport in the basin occurs under conditions of lower water discharge compared to the pre-drought period, we also interpret the drought inhibits sediment transport in this system. Considering future climate projections for central Chile, it is likely that sedimentary dynamics in this basin, as well as similar fluvial basins in the region, will continue changing as the dry hydroclimatic conditions continue in the coming decades.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This article provides a practical guide to identifying the diverse pulmonary disease patterns in IEI based on lung imaging and respiratory manifestations, and integrates this clinical information with molecular mechanisms of disease and diagnostic assessments in IEI. We cover the entire IEI spectrum, including immunodeficiencies and immune dysregulation with monogenic autoimmunity and autoinflammation, as well as recently described IEI with pulmonary manifestations. Although the pulmonary manifestations of IEI are highly relevant for all age groups, special emphasis is placed on the pediatric population, because initial presentations often occur during childhood.

Plastic pollution and infectious diseases,/articles/plastic-pollution-and-infectious-diseases,"This Personal View supports SDG 3 by explaining how plastic waste can facilitate the proliferation and propogation of infectious diseases, including arthropod-borne and water-borne diseases, among its other negative effects on the environment",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"The versatility and resistance of plastic allowed for its massive use during the second half of the 20th century. Plastic is hardly degradable and—because waste management is often inefficient—around 55% ends up either in landfill or in nature. Plastic mismanagement thus durably pollutes the environment. Although several studies have pointed out the effect of microplastic and nanoplastic pollution on global health, few have focused on the effect of macroplastics on the proliferation and propagation of infectious diseases and thus on human and livestock health. Plastic debris that holds water can encourage arthropod-borne disease by providing a habitat for some vectors’ immature stages and shelter to anthropophilic and medically important species, potentially increasing local vector populations with implications for disease burden. Similarly, by acting as a stagnant water reservoir, waste plastic promotes the development of pathogenic bacteria (such as leptospirosis) and harmful algae. These microorganisms can produce biofilms, coating plastic fragments that can then colonise new water bodies. These concerns point to the need for a transdisciplinary approach to understand and potentially prevent plastic debris from influencing local vector-borne and waterborne diseases.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Methods: We conducted this prospective analysis based on the UK Biobank cohort. CMM was defined as the coexistence of at least two cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease and stroke. Multi-state model was used to analyze the association between air pollution and the trajectory of CMM. Findings: 410,494 middle- and old-age participants were included. During a median follow-up of 12.0 years, 56,877 participants developed first cardiometabolic disease (FCMD), 8616 developed CMM, and 22,423 died. The risks of transitions from baseline to FCMD, from FCMD to CMM, and transitions from baseline and FCMD to all-cause mortality increased by 3% (2%, 5%), 3% (1%, 6%), 5% (2%, 7%) and 2% (−1%, 6%), respectively, per interquartile range increase of fine particulate matter.

ANT1 overexpression in Xenopus laevis embryos affected skeletal muscle development, impaired skeletal muscle, altered mitochondrial ultrastructure and led to oxidative stress as observed in FSHD muscle biopsies. Moreover, ANT1 overexpression in X. laevis embryos affected heart structure and mitochondrial ultrastructure leading to cardiac arrhythmia, as described in some patients with FSHD.

The project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) aims to standardize the measurement of women's agency and enable the assessment of impact over typical project timelines. Within the Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM) cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Habiganj, Sylhet, Bangladesh, we examined quantitative pro-WEAI data collected from a subsample of trial participants and their husbands (n = 885) approximately four months after the end of the intervention. We evaluated the impact of a three-year homestead food production program on men's and women's agency separately by pro-WEAI domain and indicator, using multilevel logistic and linear regression. We show that women in the FAARM intervention group had levels of agency similar to men and much higher than women in the control group (Odds Ratio [OR] 7.7, p < 0.001), corresponding to better gender equity in intervention areas (OR 3.5, p < 0.001). The higher levels of agency among intervention women were driven by greater intrinsic and collective agency but not by instrumental agency. Compared to controls, more women in the intervention group found intimate partner violence unacceptable (OR 3.5, p < 0.001), had greater ownership of assets (OR 2.6, p = 0.001), better control of income (OR 1.8, p = 0.042), higher levels of group membership (OR 14.0, p < 0.001), and membership in groups they considered influential (OR 166.8, p < 0.001).

Methods: We did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking at a 5 km × 5 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2·1 million household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with household air pollution. Findings: Although primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205 000 (95% uncertainty interval 147 000–257 000) children younger than 5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air pollution. Interpretation: Efforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.

Effect modification of greenness on the association between heat and mortality: A multi-city multi-country study,/articles/effect-modification-greenness-association-between-heat-and-mortality-multi-city-multi,This Article supports SDG 3 and 13 by analysing a dataset of 452 locations from 24 countries and showing that that the heat-mortality risks differed with greenspace category and the cities with higher greenspace values had lower heat-mortality risk than those with lower greenspace values.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background: Identifying how greenspace impacts the temperature-mortality relationship in urban environments is crucial, especially given climate change and rapid urbanization. However, the effect modification of greenspace on heat-related mortality has been typically focused on a localized area or single country. This study examined the heat-mortality relationship among different greenspace levels in a global setting. Methods: We collected daily ambient temperature and mortality data for 452 locations in 24 countries and used Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as the greenspace measurement. We used distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the heat-mortality relationship in each city and the estimates were pooled adjusting for city-specific average temperature, city-specific temperature range, city-specific population density, and gross domestic product (GDP). The effect modification of greenspace was evaluated by comparing the heat-related mortality risk for different greenspace groups (low, medium, and high), which were divided into terciles among 452 locations. Findings: Cities with high greenspace value had the lowest heat-mortality relative risk of 1·19 (95% CI: 1·13, 1·25), while the heat-related relative risk was 1·46 (95% CI: 1·31, 1·62) for cities with low greenspace when comparing the 99th temperature and the minimum mortality temperature. A 20% increase of greenspace is associated with a 9·02% (95% CI: 8·88, 9·16) decrease in the heat-related attributable fraction, and if this association is causal (which is not within the scope of this study to assess), such a reduction could save approximately 933 excess deaths per year in 24 countries. Interpretation: Our findings can inform communities on the potential health benefits of greenspaces in the urban environment and mitigation measures regarding the impacts of climate change.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Deficits in mitochondrial function and redox deregulation have been attributed to Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder largely affecting the striatum. However, whether these changes occur in early stages of the disease and can be detected in vivo is still unclear. In the present study, we analysed changes in mitochondrial function and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at early stages and with disease progression. Studies were performed in vivo in human brain by PET using [64Cu]-ATSM and ex vivo in human skin fibroblasts of premanifest and prodromal (Pre-M) and manifest HD carriers. In vivo brain [64Cu]-ATSM PET in YAC128 transgenic mouse and striatal and cortical isolated mitochondria were assessed at presymptomatic (3 month-old, mo) and symptomatic (6-12 mo) stages. Pre-M HD carriers exhibited enhanced whole-brain (with exception of caudate) [64Cu]-ATSM labelling, correlating with CAG repeat number. Fibroblasts from Pre-M showed enhanced basal and maximal respiration, proton leak and increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, later progressing in manifest HD. Mitochondria from fibroblasts of Pre-M HD carriers also showed reduced circularity, while higher number of mitochondrial DNA copies correlated with maximal respiratory capacity. In vivo animal PET analysis showed increased accumulation of [64Cu]-ATSM in YAC128 mouse striatum. YAC128 mouse (at 3 months) striatal isolated mitochondria exhibited a rise in basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration and in ATP production, and increased complex II and III activities. YAC128 mouse striatal mitochondria also showed enhanced mitochondrial H2O2 levels and circularity, revealed by brain ultrastructure analysis, and defects in Ca2+ handling, supporting increased striatal susceptibility. Data demonstrate both human and mouse mitochondrial overactivity and altered morphology at early HD stages, facilitating redox unbalance, the latter progressing with manifest disease.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"Health service planning to assess the expected impact of centralising specialist cancer services on travel times, equity, and outcomes: a national population-based modelling study",/articles/health-service-planning-assess-expected-impact-centralising-specialist-cancer-services,"This Article supports SDG 3 by estimating the impacts of the centralisation of specialist cancer services, focusing on travel time, equity of access, outcomes, and hospital workload. Using rectal cancer surgery centres as an example the authors found increases in travel times but reductions in readmission rates.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Centralisation of specialist cancer services is occurring in many countries, often without evaluating the potential impact before implementation. We developed a health service planning model that can estimate the expected impacts of different centralisation scenarios on travel time, equity in access to services, patient outcomes, and hospital workload, using rectal cancer surgery as an example. Methods: For this population-based modelling study, we used routinely collected individual patient-level data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) and linked to the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database for 11 888 patients who had been diagnosed with rectal cancer between April 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2018, and who subsequently underwent a major rectal cancer resection in 163 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals providing rectal cancer surgery in England. Five centralisation scenarios were considered: closure of lower-volume centres (scenario A); closure of non-comprehensive cancer centres (scenario B); closure of centres with a net loss of patients to other centres (scenario C); closure of centres meeting all three criteria in scenarios A, B, and C (scenario D); and closure of centres with high readmission rates (scenario E). We used conditional logistic regression to predict probabilities of affected patients moving to each of the remaining centres and the expected changes in travel time, multilevel logistic regression to predict 30-day emergency readmission rates, and linear regression to analyse associations between the expected extra travel time for patients whose centre is closed and five patient characteristics, including age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, comorbidity, and rurality of the patients' residential areas (rural, urban [non-London], or London). We also quantified additional workload, defined as the number of extra patients reallocated to remaining centres. Findings: Of the 11 888 patients, 4130 (34·7%) were women, 5249 (44·2%) were aged 70 years and older, and 5005 (42·1%) had at least one comorbidity. Scenario A resulted in closures of 43 (26%) of the 163 rectal cancer surgery centres, affecting 1599 (13·5%) patients; scenario B resulted in closures of 112 (69%) centres, affecting 7029 (59·1%) patients; scenario C resulted in closures of 56 (34%) centres, affecting 3142 (26·4%) patients; scenario D resulted in closures of 24 (15%) centres, affecting 874 (7·4%) patients; and scenario E resulted in closures of 16 (10%) centres, affecting 1000 (8·4%) patients. For each scenario, there was at least a two-times increase in predicted travel time for re-allocated patients with a mean increase in travel time of 23 min; however, the extra travel time did not disproportionately affect vulnerable patient groups. All scenarios resulted in significant reductions in 30-day readmission rates (range 4–48%). Three hospitals in scenario A, 41 hospitals in in scenario B, 13 hospitals in scenario C, no hospitals in scenario D, and two hospitals in scenario E had to manage at least 20 extra patients annually. Interpretation: This health service planning model can be used to to guide complex decisions about the closure of centres and inform mitigation strategies. The approach could be applied across different country or regional health-care systems for patients with cancer and other complex health conditons.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how the changed work routines during the COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the working environment for hospital-based maternity and neonatal health care workers, and to identify preventive measures to be used in future situations when health care organizations are under pressure. Methods: All maternity and neonatal health care workers in a Swedish university hospital were surveyed during October 2019 and September 2020. The data was analyzed by document analysis of implemented changes in working routines, a quantitative analysis of the overall effects on the working conditions, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended responses. Results: A total of 660 maternity and neonatal health care workers completed the pre-COVID-19 survey (74% response rate) and 382 the COVID-19 survey (35% response rate). Lack of personal protective equipment, worry about becoming infected, uncertainty whether implemented changes were enough, and challenges in communicating updated routines had negative effects on maternity and neonatal health care workers’ working conditions. Team spirit and feeling valued by peers had a positive effect. Conclusions: Results suggest that negative effects on maternity and neonatal health care workers’ health can partly be prevented in future critical situations by creating a work climate that acknowledges the employees’ worry about being infected, securing adequate pre-conditions for managers, creating a strong psychosocial safety climate and systematically improving the working conditions for the maternity and neonatal health care workers, as well as maintaining the positive perceived effects of increased team spirit and feeling valued by peers.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The additional impact of a recent change in donor allocation on disparities in HT in the United States (US) is unknown. We hypothesize racial disparities in HT are present and may be worsened by new allocation practices. Methods: Cohort: Adults listed for HT before and after a heart allocation policy change (Era 1: Oct 18th, 2015 - Oct 18th, 2018, Era 2: Oct 18th, 2018-June 30, 2021). The primary outcome was the rate of HT by race (Black vs. White), assessed using multivariable competing risk analysis (compete: waitlist removal for death or clinical deterioration). Final adjusted models included co-morbidities, SES and community-level Social Determinants of Health. The secondary outcome was waitlist removal for death or clinical deterioration. Results: Of 17,384 waitlist candidates (Era 1: 9,150, Era 2: 8,234), Black waitlist candidates had a lower rate of HT compared to White waitlist candidates in Era 1 (adjusted HR 0·90, 95 % CI 0·84-0·97, p = 0·0053) and in Era 2 (adjusted HR 0·81, 95 % CI 0·75-0·88, p <0·0001, era race interaction p=0·056).

",Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy,"Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, notably carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing global climate change, which poses enormous hazards to human life, the environment, development, and sustainability. Bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural country experiencing continuous economic growth and rapid urbanization which is causing higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The present study empirically explores the nexus between economic growth, energy use, urbanization, agricultural productivity, and CO2 emissions in Bangladesh. Time series data from 1972 to 2018 were utilized by employing the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) approach. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test revealed evidence of cointegration among the variables in the long run which has been verified by the Johansen cointegration test and Engle-Granger cointegration test. The empirical findings reveal that economic growth, energy use, urbanization, and reduced agricultural productivity increase CO2 emissions in Bangladesh. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS), and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). In addition, the pairwise Granger causality test is utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"Water security is under threat worldwide from climate change. A warming climate would accelerate evaporation and cryosphere melting, leading to reduced water availability and unpredictable water supply. However, the water crisis in the Northern Slope of Tianshan Mountains (NSTM) faces dual challenges because water demands for fast-growing urban areas have put heavy pressure on water resources. The mountain-oasis-desert system features glacier-fed rivers that sustain intensive water use in the oasis and end in the desert as fragile terminal lakes. The complex balance between water conservation and economic development is subtle. This paper investigates changes in hydroclimatic variables and water security-related issues on the NSTM. The spatiotemporal variations in glaciers, climatic variables, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, groundwater, surface water, human water use, and streamflow were analyzed for the past four decades. The results show that temperature in the NSTM exhibited an apparent upward trend with a more significant warming rate in the higher altitude regions. Glacier mass loss and shrinkage was strong. The average annual streamflow increased from 1980-1989 to 2006–2011 at most hydrological stations. The monthly dynamics of surface water area showed notable variability at both inter-annual and seasonal scales, revealing the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic drivers on surface water availability in the region. The terrestrial water storage anomaly showed a decreasing trend, which might be related to groundwater pumping for irrigation. Human water use for agriculture and industry grew with the increase in cultivated land area and gross domestic product (GDP). The increased agricultural water use was strongly associated with the expansion of oases. It is unclear whether water availability would remain high under future climatic and hydrological uncertainties, posing challenges to water management. In the context of rapid urban growth and climate change, balancing water for humans and nature is vital in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in NSTM. This study provides a baseline understanding of the interplay among water, climate change, and socio-economic development in NSTM. It would also shed light on wise water management under environmental changes for other rapidly developing mountain-oasis-desert systems worldwide.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In this study, by targeting three typical seasonal snow-covered land types (i.e., open shrubland, evergreen needleleaf forest and mixed forest) in the Northern Hemisphere, the start of growing season (SGS) has been found obviously advanced in the past years, greatly contributed by the faster melting rate of seasonal snow. It is manifested that significantly positive correlation has been found between SGS and May snow depth for open shrubs, March and April snow depth for evergreen needleleaf forests and March snow depth for mixed forests. However, such close association is not appeared in all the climate conditions of same vegetation. In the future, as the rate of melting snow becomes faster in the high emission of greenhouse gasses than the current situation, continuously advanced SGS will accelerate the change of vegetation distribution in the Northern Hemisphere.

"A community mobilisation intervention to improve engagement in HIV testing, linkage to care, and retention in care in South Africa: a cluster-randomised controlled trial",/articles/community-mobilisation-intervention-improve-engagement-hiv-testing-linkage-care-and,"An Article in support of SDG 3, assessing whether community mobilisation increases HIV testing, linkage to care, and retention in care over time in intervention relative to control communities.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Community mobilisation, engaging communities in a process to collectively enact change, could improve HIV testing and care engagement. In South Africa, current rates fall below those needed for epidemic control. We assessed whether community mobilisation increased HIV testing, linkage to care, and retention in care over time in intervention relative to control communities. Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial in villages in the Agincourt sub-district of the rural Mpumalanga Province in South Africa. 15 villages were randomly assigned to either a community mobilisation intervention engaging residents to address social barriers to HIV testing and treatment (intervention arm) or to a control arm using balanced randomisation. Villages were eligible if they had been fully enumerated in 2014, had not been included in previous mobilisation activities, and included over 500 permanent adult residents aged 18–49 years. Primary outcomes included quarterly rates of HIV testing, linkage to care, and retention in care documented from health facility records among residents of the intervention and control communities over the 3-year study period. Intention-to-treat analyses employed generalised estimating equations stratified by sex. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02197793. Findings: Between Aug 1, 2015, and July 31, 2018, residents in eight intervention communities (n=20 544 residents) and seven control communities (n=17 848) contributed data; 92 residents contributed to both arms. Among men, HIV testing increased quarterly by 12·1% (relative change [RC] 1·121, 95% CI 1·099 to 1·143, p<0·0001) in the intervention communities and 9·5% (1·095, 1·075 to 1·114, p=0·011) in the control communities; although increases in testing were greater in the intervention villages, differences did not reach significance (exponentiated interaction coefficient 1·024, 95% CI 0·997 to 1·052, p=0·078). Among women, HIV testing increased quarterly by 10·6% (RC 1·106, 95% CI 1·097 to 1·114, p<0·0001) in the intervention communities and 9·3% (1·093, 1·084 to 1·102, p=0·053) in the control communities; increases were greater in intervention communities (exponentiated interaction coefficient 1·012, 95% CI 1·001 to 1·023, p=0·043). Quarterly linkage increased significantly among women in the intervention communities (RC 1·013, 95% CI 1·002 to 1·023, p=0·018) only. Quarterly linkage fell among men in both arms, but decreased significantly among men in the control communities (0·977, 0·954 to 1·002, p=0·043). Quarterly retention fell among women in both arms; however, reductions were tempered among women in the intervention communities (exponentiated interaction coefficient 1·003, 95% CI <1·000 to 1·006, p=0·062). Retention fell significantly among men in both arms with difference in rates of decline. Interpretation: Community mobilisation was associated with modest improvements in select trial outcomes. The sum of these incremental, quarterly improvements achieved by addressing social barriers to HIV care engagement can impact epidemic control. However, achieving optimal impacts will probably require integrated efforts addressing both social barriers through community mobilisation and provision of improved service delivery.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Typhoid fever is a substantial public health problem in Africa, yet there are few clinical trials of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV). We assessed immunogenicity and safety of Typbar TCV in Malawi. Methods: This substudy was nested within a phase 3, double-blind, parallel design, randomised controlled trial of TCV in children from Ndirande Health Centre in Ndirande township, Blantyre, Malawi. To be eligible, participants had to be aged between 9 months and 12 years with no known immunosuppression or chronic health conditions, including HIV or severe malnutrition; eligible participants were enrolled into three strata of approximately 200 children (9–11 months, 1–5 years, and 6–12 years), randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TCV or control (meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine [MCV-A]) intramuscularly. Serum was collected before vaccination and at 28 days and 730–1035 days after vaccination to measure anti-Vi antibodies by ELISA. Because of COVID-19, day 730 visits were extended up to 1035 days. This nested substudy evaluated reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity by age stratum. Safety outcomes, analysed in the intention-to-treat population, included solicited adverse events within 7 days of vaccination (assessed on 3 separate days) and unsolicited adverse events within 28 days of vaccination. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03299426. Findings: Between Feb 22 and Sept 6, 2018, 664 participants were screened, and 631 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (320 to the TCV group and 311 to the MCV-A group). 305 participants in the TCV group and 297 participants in the MCV-A group were vaccinated. Among TCV recipients, anti-Vi IgG geometric mean titres increased more than 500 times from 4·2 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95% CI 4·0–4·4) at baseline to 2383·7 EU/mL (2087·2–2722·3) at day 28, then decreased to 48·0 EU/mL (39·9–57·8) at day 730–1035, remaining more than 11 times higher than baseline. Among MCV-A recipients, anti-Vi IgG titres remained unchanged: 4·3 EU/mL (4·0–4·5) at baseline, 4·4 EU/mL (4·0–4·7) on day 28, and 4·6 EU/mL (4·2–5·0) on day 730–1035. TCV and MCV-A recipients had similar solicited local (eight [3%] of 304, 95% CI 1·3–5·1 and three [1%] of 293, 0·4–3·0) and systemic (27 [9%] of 304, 6·2–12·6 and 27 [9%] of 293, 6·4–13·1) reactogenicity. Related unsolicited adverse events occurred similarly in TCV and MCV-A recipients in eight (3%) of 304 (1·3–5·1) and eight (3%) of 293 (1·4–5·3).

	The climate crisis and its impact on human health are already being felt around the world, and are projected to worsen in the coming decades. There is a need to address the health vulnerability of populations. Health vulnerability and adaptation assessments are being carried out at various scales to contribute towards adaptation planning. Several tools and methods have been developed and applied in different contexts.
	Methods
	This scoping review was able to identify 25 tools and methods for assessing health vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review guidelines. Data on the methods used, unit of assessment, scope of climatic hazards and health concerns addressed, consideration of climate projections, stakeholder involvement, and tool outputs were extracted.
	Results
	Most of the identified papers were based on assessments conducted in high-income countries (56%). The majority of the approaches assessed health vulnerability at the level of a district or below (72%). Over half of the approaches considered all the relevant climate hazards (52%) and health concerns (52%) during the assessment, while some approaches only focused on one or a few specific aspects such as extreme heat (16%) or dengue (8%). Information about the resources needed for conducting these assessments was unavailable.
	Conclusions
	While health planners may benefit from the description of approaches for health vulnerability assessment included in this review, evaluations of the approaches applied in particular contexts can provide additional rich insights. In addition, these assessment approaches should be piloted in neglected locations, and new approaches should be developed based on contextual needs and identified gaps.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This study aimed to identify these impairments among children aged 9–12 years with different schizophrenia risk profiles (family history or antecedents of schizophrenia, each of higher[H] or lower[L] risk load) relative to typically developing peers. These three groups were recruited via community-screening, and differentiated for analysis into: typically developing children (TD = 45); children who had 1 first- or ≥2 second-degree affected relatives (FHxH = 16) or one second-degree relative (FHxL = 15); and children presenting multiple replicated antecedents of schizophrenia whose clinical symptoms persisted at 2- and/or 4-year follow-up (ASzH = 16) or remitted during follow-up (ASzL = 16). Verbal learning/memory measures assessed at baseline (age 9–12 years) included: (i) total recall; (ii) trial 1 recall; (iii) learning score; (iv) intrusions; (v) total words lost; and (vi) serial position patterns. Analyses of variance indicated that FHxH and ASzH youth demonstrated impaired total recall compared to TD and ASzL children and lost significantly more words between trials than TD and FHxL children. Learning score was impaired among both FHxH and FHxL relative to TD and ASzL children. Thus, among putatively at-risk children, total words recalled and lost distinguished those with higher risk load (by family history or persistent antecedent symptomology), whereas learning score indexed familial vulnerability.

Digital technology for addressing cognitive impairment in recent-onset psychosis: A perspective,/articles/digital-technology-addressing-cognitive-impairment-recent-onset-psychosis-perspective,Ways to improve cognitive impairment caused by psychosis.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Cognitive impairments in psychosis negatively impact functional recovery and quality of life. Existing interventions for improving cognitive impairment in recent-onset psychosis show inconsistent treatment efficacy, small effects, suboptimal engagement and limited generalizability to daily life functioning. In this perspective we explore how digital technology has the potential to address these limitations in order to improve cognitive and functional outcomes in recent-onset psychosis. Computer programs can be used for standardized, automated delivery of cognitive remediation training. Virtual reality provides the opportunity for learning and practicing cognitive skills in real-world scenarios within a virtual environment. Smartphone apps could be used for notification reminders for everyday tasks to compensate for cognitive difficulties. Internet-based technologies can offer psychoeducation and training materials for enhancing cognitive skills. Early findings indicate some forms of digital interventions for cognitive enhancement can be effective, with well-established evidence for human-supported computer-based cognitive remediation in recent-onset psychosis. Emerging evidence regarding virtual reality is favorable for improving social cognition. Overall, blending digital interventions with human support improves engagement and effectiveness. Despite the potential of digital interventions for enhancing cognition in recent-onset psychosis, few studies have been conducted to date. Implementation challenges affecting application of digital technologies for cognitive impairment in recent-onset psychosis are sustained engagement, clinical integration, and lack of quality in the commercial marketplace.

We used environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to document the breadth of high-alpine biodiversity present on Earth's highest mountain, Mt. Everest (8,849 m a.s.l.) in Nepal's Khumbu region. In April-May 2019, we collected eDNA from ten ponds and streams between 4,500 m and 5,500 m. Using multiple sequencing and bioinformatic approaches, we identified taxa from 36 phyla and 187 potential orders across the Tree of Life in Mt. Everest's high-alpine and aeolian ecosystem. These organisms, all recorded above 4,500 m—an elevational belt comprising <3% of Earth's land surface—represents ∼16% of global taxonomic order estimates. Our eDNA inventory will aid future high-Himalayan biomonitoring and retrospective molecular studies to assess changes over time as climate-driven warming, glacial melt, and anthropogenic influences reshape this rapidly transforming world-renowned ecosystem.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 15: Life on land,"COVID-19 has devastated global communities and economies. The pandemic has exposed socioeconomic disparities and weaknesses in health systems worldwide. Long-term health effects and economic recovery are major concerns. Ecosystem restoration—ie, the repair of ecosystems that have been degraded—relates directly to tackling the health and socioeconomic burdens of COVID-19, because stable and resilient ecosystems are fundamental determinants of health and socioeconomic stability. Here, we use COVID-19 as a case study, showing how ecosystem restoration can reduce the risk of infection and adverse sequelae and have an integral role in humanity's recovery from COVID-19. The next decade will be crucial for humanity's recovery from COVID-19 and for ecosystem repair. Indeed, in the absence of effective, large-scale restoration, 95% of the Earth's land could be degraded by 2050. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–30) declaration reflects the growing urgency and scale at which we should repair ecosystems. Importantly, ecosystem restoration could also help to combat the health and socioeconomic issues that are associated with COVID-19, yet it is poorly integrated into current responses to the disease. Ecosystem restoration can be a core public health intervention and assist in COVID-19 recovery if it is closely integrated with socioeconomic, health, and environmental policies.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

In this article, we quantify and evaluate the life-cycle environmental impacts of selected mask options available for use by healthcare workers in the UK, with the objective of supporting decision- and policy-making. We investigate alternatives to traditional single-use face masks like surgical masks and respirators (or FFP3 masks), including cloth masks decontaminated in washing machines; FFP3 masks decontaminated via vapour hydrogen peroxide, and rigid half masks cleaned with antibacterial wipes. Our analysis demonstrates that: (1) the reuse options analysed are environmentally preferential to the traditional “use then dispose” of masks; (2) the environmental benefits increase with the number of reuses; and (3) the manufacturing location and the material composition of the masks have great influence over the life-cycle environmental impacts of each mask use option, in particular for single-use options.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"Pyschological responses, mental health, and sense of agency for the dual challenges of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic in young people in the UK: an online survey study",/articles/pyschological-responses-mental-health-and-sense-agency-dual-challenges-climate-change-and,"An Article in support of SDGs 3 and 13, assessing psychological responses among young people to the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, particularly focusing on mental health conditions and feelings of agency.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background
	The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are both significant and pressing global challenges, posing threats to public health and wellbeing. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the distress both crises can cause, but understanding of the varied psychological responses to both issues is poor. We aimed to investigate these responses and their links with mental health conditions and feelings of agency.
	Methods
	We conducted an online survey between Aug 5 and Oct 26, 2020, targeting a diverse sample of young people (aged 16–24 years, n=530) in the UK. The survey was distributed using a combination of a survey panel (panel sample) and direct approaches to youth groups and schools who shared the survey with young people in their networks (community sample). We collected data on respondents’ psychological responses to both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, their sense of agency to respond to each crisis, and the range of impacts on their lives. We also collected demographics data and screened for mental health and wellbeing indicators. We used non-parametric tests for most statistical comparisons. For paired samples, we used Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, and used Mann-Whitney U-tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests for two or more independent samples. Summed scale scores were considered as interval-level data and analysed with Student's t tests and ANOVAs. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's d and partial eta-squared (η·2p), respectively.
	Findings
	After excluding 18 suspected bots and 94 incomplete responses, 530 responses were retained for analysis. Of the 518 respondents who provided demographic data, 63% were female, 71·4% were White, and the mean family affluence score was 8·22 (SD 2·29). Most participants (n=343; 70%) did not report a history of diagnosis or treatment for a mental health disorder, but mental health scores indicated a common experience of (relatively mild) symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. Although UK youth reported more life disruption and concern for their future due to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change was associated with significantly greater distress overall, particularly for individuals with low levels of generalised anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic was more associated with feelings of anxiety, isolation, disconnection, and frustration; distress around loss and grief; and effects on quality of life. Climate change was more likely to evoke emotions such as interest and engagement, guilt, shame, anger, and disgust. The greater distress attributed to climate change overall was due, in particular, to higher levels of guilt, sense of personal responsibility, and greater distress triggered by upsetting media coverage. Agency to address climate change was associated with greater climate distress, but pandemic-related distress and agency were unrelated.
	Interpretation
	The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are affecting the wellbeing of UK young people in distinct ways, with implications for health service, policy, and research responses. There is a need for mental health practitioners, policy makers, and other societal actors to account for the complex relationship between climate agency, distress, and mental wellbeing in young people.

Factors that influence the implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in healthcare leadership: A meta-ethnographic study,/articles/factors-influence-implementation-organisational-interventions-advancing-women-healthcare,This Article supports SDG 5 by examining factors associated with implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in health-care leadership.,Goal 5: Gender equality,"Background: Gender inequity in healthcare leadership persists and progress is slow, with the focus firmly on problems, barriers and on requiring women themselves to adapt and compete in a system not designed for them. Women are individually burdened to advance their careers, with little effort given to addressing systemic barriers in the health sector. A recent systematic review prioritised organisational-level approaches and demonstrated effective interventions. In this meta-ethnographic study, we further this work by examining factors in implementation of organisational interventions for advancing women in leadership. Methods: The meta-ethnographic framework applied here follows the Noblit and Hare approach for synthesising findings and applying interpretive analysis to original research. We generated a new line-of-argument with insights for the healthcare sector. The protocol is registered (CRD42020162115) on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Three academic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS) were searched systematically between 2000 and 2021. Studies were analysed if they included organisational-level interventions that sought to measurably advance women in leadership. Study characteristics were extracted using a standard template for intervention details. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. Data synthesis was conducted across 19 criteria of the Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guide (eMERGe). Findings: Fifteen qualitative studies were included. Analysis revealed three meta-themes that are central to successful implementation of organisational interventions that advance women in healthcare leadership: (1) leadership commitment and accountability, influenced by internal and external organisational settings, salient for long term outcomes and for developing an inclusive leadership culture; (2) intervention fit with individuals with consideration given to personal beliefs, preferences, experiences, capabilities or life circumstances, including capacity for leadership roles in their broader life context; balanced against maintaining interventional fidelity, and (3) cultural climate and organisational readiness for change, addressing traditional, conservative and constrictive perspectives on gender and leadership in health, highlighting the facilitating role of male colleagues. Interpretation: This meta-ethnographic research extends past work by integrating empirical evidence from a systematic literature review of effective organisational level interventions, with the identification of pragmatic themes to generate, implement, evaluate and embed evidence-based organisational interventions to advance women in healthcare leadership. This work can inform initiatives and policymakers to generate and implement new knowledge to advance women in healthcare leadership.

Our Review indicates substantial gender differences in exposure to unpaid labour and confirms persistent inequities in the division of unpaid work. Overall, our findings indicate that, among employed adults, unpaid labour is negatively associated with women's mental health, with effects less apparent for men.

The consequences of CoQ deficiency have not been fully addressed, and effective treatment remains challenging. Here, we use mice with primary CoQ deficiency (Coq9R239X), and we demonstrate that CoQ deficiency profoundly alters the Q-junction, leading to extensive changes in the mitochondrial proteome and metabolism in the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, in the brain. CoQ deficiency also induces reactive gliosis, which mediates a neuroinflammatory response, both of which lead to an encephalopathic phenotype. Importantly, treatment with either vanillic acid (VA) or β-resorcylic acid (β-RA), two analogs of the natural precursor for CoQ biosynthesis, partially restores CoQ metabolism, particularly in the kidneys, and induces profound normalization of the mitochondrial proteome and metabolism, ultimately leading to reductions in gliosis, neuroinflammation and spongiosis and, consequently, reversing the phenotype. Together, these results provide key mechanistic insights into defects in CoQ metabolism and identify potential disease biomarkers. Furthermore, our findings clearly indicate that the use of analogs of the CoQ biosynthetic precursor is a promising alternative therapy for primary CoQ deficiency and has potential for use in the treatment of more common neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases that are associated with secondary CoQ deficiency.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Economic costs of dementia in 11 countries in Europe: Estimates from nationally representative cohorts of a panel study,/articles/economic-costs-dementia-11-countries-europe-estimates-nationally-representative-cohorts,"An article on dementia and Alzheimer's disease costs, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the economic costs of care in Europe.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: With population aging, the economic burden of dementia is growing in Europe. Understanding the economic costs of dementia provides an important basis for prioritization in public health policy and resource allocation. Methods: We calculate the economic costs of dementia, including both direct medical and social care costs and indirect costs of informal care, for 11 countries in Europe. Costs are estimated using population-representative data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe from 2004 to 2017, supplemented with external information about wages of care workers, dementia prevalence, and fraction of direct costs paid by other sources. We report overall costs for persons, both living and deceased with dementia and also isolate the costs attributable to dementia by estimating regression models that relate a given cost component to dementia while controlling for coexisting conditions and demographics. We make the monetary data comparable by adjusting for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity to 2018 euros. Findings: Average annual direct out of pocket costs that can be attributed to dementia vary between EUR 253(95% CI: -17 to 522) and EUR 859 (95% CI: -587 to 2306) across countries, but are not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing. Average annual hours of informal care that can be attributed to dementia vary between 163 (95% CI: 27–299) and 1051 (95% CI: 15–2086) annual hours across countries, and are statistically significant in all countries before adjustment for multiple testing, and in seven out of 11 countries after this adjustment. Combining these estimates with external wage information in each country implies a burden between EUR 2687.4 (95% CI: 704.5 to 4670.3) and EUR 15,468 (95% CI: 8088.1 to 22,847.9) per individual with dementia per year depending on the country. When combined with external estimates of the fraction of direct costs covered by other payment sources (insurance, government) and numbers of individuals with dementia, estimates of the total costs of dementia at the country level vary from EUR 162.9 million (95% CI: 56.3 to 269.5) in Estonia to EUR 32,606.9 (95% CI: 13,893.9 to 51,319.9) in Germany. Informal care costs account for the largest proportion of costs attributable to dementia in all European countries, varying between about 50% and about 90%. Interpretation: The economic burden of dementia on families in terms of direct out-of-pocket and informal care costs varies greatly by country, depending on the health and social care systems. Informal care costs accounts for the largest proportion of costs, requiring policy attention to dementia care provision and costs.

Studies documenting these risks are emerging from middle-to-low-income countries, but research is comparatively deficient when it comes to developed nations, especially the United States (US). This is troubling given that the US is the second largest annual emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the world and has endured over $16 billion worth of climate disasters annually for the past five years[4], [5].

Timing of perinatal mental health needs: data to inform policy,/articles/timing-perinatal-mental-health-needs-data-inform-policy,"Perinatal mental health needs, including suicidal ideation, are often first recognized beyond 8 weeks postpartum. These data should be taken into consideration in policymaking discussions pertaining to the approach to medical care continuity and postpartum healthcare coverage.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"The policies pertaining to perinatal healthcare should be informed by medical needs. The windows of standard obstetrical care and mandated Medicaid coverage eligibility typically end approximately 8 weeks postpartum, even though women may have perinatal health concerns, including suicidal ideation, which are identified beyond this period. To evaluate the timing of mental health needs across the perinatal period with a focus on how frequently the initial referral and suicidal ideation occur outside of standard obstetrical care windows. This retrospective cohort study included all women during pregnancy or up to one year postpartum referred to a perinatal mental health collaborative care program (COMPASS) between September 2017 and September 2019. The timing of initial referral to COMPASS was identified, with women referred postpartum categorized by whether the referral was made after 8 weeks postpartum. The characteristics of the women were compared according to the timing of the initial mental health referral with receiver operating characteristic curves to identify whether patient characteristics could accurately classify women whose initial mental health needs were not recognized until after 8 weeks postpartum. Similarly, the assessment of suicidal ideation, either at or after referral, was ascertained, with the evaluation of the timing at which suicidal ideation was first expressed. Of 1421 women referred for mental healthcare during the study period, 774 (54%) were initially referred antenatally and 647 (46%) were initially referred postpartum.

"Stress, anxiety, and the erosion of trust: Maternity staffs’ experiences of incident management",/articles/stress-anxiety-and-erosion-trust-maternity-staffs%E2%80%99-experiences-incident-management,This study reinforces understanding that adverse incidents have a profound impact on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals. ,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth,"Adverse incidents in maternity care and other healthcare systems continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality with significant financial cost to healthcare organisations, patients, and their families. Over the last decades healthcare organisations have focused their attention on improving the quality of patient care, safety, and experience. However, very little attention has been given to understanding and improving staff experience. This is despite the high probability that healthcare professionals who experience their workplace positively will deliver higher quality care, report incidents more commonly, and actively engage in incident investigation and learning processes.  The purpose of the study is to explore maternity staffs’ experiences of the incident reporting and investigation process, with specific reference to its impact on trust in local risk management leadership and organizational process. Semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews analyzed using a methodological procedure that reveals the human experience of complex social phenomena (Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis).  Tertiary university maternity teaching hospital in England (UK) with approximately 6000 deliveries per annum. A purposive sample of 10 staff (2 consultants, 3 specialist registrars and 5 midwives) all involved in incidents requiring formal investigation during the preceding 12 months. The lived experiences, personal feelings, and perceptions of how the incident reporting and investigation process impacts on their trust in the risk management leadership and organizational process. Incident reporting and investigation were found to be perceived by staff as very stressful events with no structured feedback and support system in place for staff. We found that this lead to diminished trust in the risk management leadership and organizational process with staff relying on colleagues for support and validation of their practice. The study showed that poorly managed processes of incident reporting and investigation result in diminished trust in risk management leadership and organizational processes. It also reinforces understanding that adverse incidents have a profound impact on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals. Factors that will likely mitigate these experiences and effects include: (1) timely updates and feedback from incident investigation; (2) high levels of leadership visibility; and (3) structured support for staff during and after incident reporting and investigations.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The literature on climate change and mental health is growing rapidly but is characterised by several limitations and research gaps. In a field where the need for designing evidence-based adaptation strategies is urgent, and research gaps are vast, implementing a broad, all-encompassing research agenda will require some strategic focus. We followed a structured approach to prioritise future climate change and mental health research. We consulted with experts working across mental health and climate change, both within and outside of research and working in high, middle, and low-income countries, to garner consensus about the future research priorities for mental health and climate change. Experts were identified based on whether they had published work on climate change and mental health, worked in governmental and non-governmental organisations on climate change and mental health, and from the professional networks of the authors who have been active in the mental health and climate change space. Twenty-two experts participated from across low- and middle-income countries (n = 4) and high-income countries (n = 18). Our process identified ten key priorities for progressing research on mental health and climate change.

",Goal 13: Climate action,"What kind of event is climate change? Theories of events inevitably begin with rupture. An event depends on the experience that the ground has dramatically shifted. Yet the ambiguity of rupture in climate change—which cannot be experienced in any one instance—makes climate change more difficult to emplot. Moreover, it is an event defined as much by how actors see the future unfolding as by its present or past. Tying the theory of events with that of future-making, we focus on three important forms of eventfulness that we find in the current climate change debate: scientific modes of eventfulness, the radical eventfulness of groups such as Extinction Rebellion, and what we call the “sensible” eventfulness of European Union and United Nations functionaries, as it is gleaned from climate change documents such as the European Green Deal. As we show, each form of eventfulness constructs a different temporal landscape, populated by different actors and actions, entailing different stances towards the future and different kinds of projects. Focusing on the tensions within each form, we then show that understanding these forms of eventfulness can also help us understand how different actors fused climate change to other events, such as that of the global Covid-19 epidemic.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

To address this gap, the current study descriptively examined perpetration rates between and across different identities, including self-identified race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender identity. In Fall 2017, 9th – 11th grade students (N = 4782) at 20 high schools in Colorado (United States) completed a survey that assessed demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender identity) and various forms of violence perpetration.

Differences in perpetration rates were also observed among various racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender minority students compared to non-minority students. This emphasizes a need for more research on how minority stress that results from the dynamics of intersecting identities and societal systems of power–including racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia–contributes to violence perpetration.

Diabetes mellitus was defined as having HA1c of greater than or equal to 6.5%, and patients were assessed for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The relationship between depression, glycemic control, and background characteristics was analyzed using Chi-square, and binary logistic regression analyses. Adjusted logistic regression models estimated the significant factors that were independently associated with depression. 20.1% of the study participants had depression with the vast majority of them having mild depression (70.8%). More than three-quarters had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (81.5%). Male patients were at higher risk for developing depression (AOR =1.98, 1.25-3.14) when compared to female patients. On the other hand, being Qatari was associated with a lower risk for depression compared to non-Qatari patients (AOR =0.56, 0.34—0.90), and treatment with insulin-containing regimens was associated with a lower risk for depression as compared to treatment with non-insulin- containing regimens (AOR =0.49, 0.30-0.78). Prevalence of depression among patients with Type 2 diabetes attending family medicine clinics in Qatar is high.

We tested the effects of highly stressful experiences during childhood and adulthood using data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale national health and biomedical study with over 500,000 participants. To do this, we defined four groups with high or low levels of childhood and/or adulthood stress. We then used T1-and diffusion-weighted MRI data to assess the macrostructure of grey matter and microstructure of white matter within limbic brain regions, commonly associated with the stress response. We also compared executive function and working memory between these groups. Our findings suggest that in females, higher levels of Childhood stress were associated with reduced connectivity within the posterior thalamic radiation and cingulum of the hippocampus. In males however, higher levels of Adulthood stress is associated with similar changes in brain microstructure in the posterior thalamic radiation and cingulum of the hippocampus. High stress in Childhood and Adulthood was associated with decreases in executive function and working memory in both males and females. Stress across the lifespan was also positively associated with the number of diagnosed mental health problems, with a stronger effect in females than in males.

We aimed 1) to compare associations between remotely sensed and street view (SV) greenness, and 2) to examine whether these greenness metrics are differently associated with mental health outcomes. We used cross-sectional depressive and anxiety symptoms data on adults in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We employed a convolutional neural network to segment greenness in SV panoramas. Greenness was measured top-down by normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from 1 m resolution orthophotos (OP) and 30 m resolution Landsat-8 (LS) imagery per postal code, and 100 and 300 m concentric and street-network buffers at the home address. Correlation analyses assessed associations across greenness measures. Covariate-adjusted regressions (e.g., noise, air pollution, deprivation) were conducted to assess associations between each greenness metric and mental health outcomes. Correlations between greenness metrics were significantly positive and moderately high. SV greenness was less sensitive across scales and residential contexts than OP and LS greenness. There was no statistically significant evidence that people with less urban residential greenness had higher depression or anxiety scores than those exposed to higher levels.

Optimum recovery of saline gradient power using reversal electrodialysis: Influence of the stack components,/articles/optimum-recovery-saline-gradient-power-using-reversal-electrodialysis-influence-stack,Blue energy recovery to increase water sustainability in wastewater treatment plants supporting SDG 6. Sustainable alternatives for water remediation in coastal wastewater treatment plants is discussed as well as the Influence of the main components and variables of a reverse electrodialysis stack. ,Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Salinity gradient power (SGP), has gained attention in last years, due to its numerous advantages as renewable and continuous source of energy. Furthermore, the possibility of deploying this new source of green energy in coastal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) offers an attractive alternative to advance the energy sustainability in these installations while contributing to increase the prospects for water reclamation. As part of a global project that integrates the recovery of SGP through reverse electrodialysis within a water reclamation process, we report the analysis of the influence of the main components of a reversal electrodialysis (RED) stack, membranes, and spacers, on the recovery of energy. Additionally, the optimal number of cell pairs and velocity of the water streams is determined to maximize the gross power density. The study is carried out with model waters with a sodium chloride concentration of 0.5 M (seawater) and 0.02 M (close to WWTP effluents) as high and low concentration solutions respectively, in a RED stack with 3 to 20 ion exchange membrane pairs. The results reveal that membrane thickness exerts a more decisive influence than the spacers thickness. Power density values as high as 1.59 W·m−2 and 1.77 W·m−2 have been obtained using membranes of 50 μm thickness and spacers of 270 and 155 μm thickness, respectively. The information here reported helps in the decision-making for the proper design of the membrane stack, making a step forward to facilitate the integration of SGP recovery within water reclamation processes, reducing fossil fuel dependence in WWTPs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Amongst strategies to meet today's nZEB performance requirements are passive building concepts. However, it is unclear to which degree such concepts aid buildings to achieve net-zero carbon targets. To address this research gap, we conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the passive nZEB concept '2226' based on its original prototype office building in Austria. We deploy a quantity takeoff and the measured end-energy demand to calculate the embodied and operational GHG emissions. In line with the recent draft of the building LCA standard EN15978, we split energy usage into building-integrated and non-integrated systems. Embodied GHG emissions make up about a third of the total life cycle GHG emissions (33%), and operational energy use accounts for two-thirds (67%) of the life cycle GHG emissions, considering the current Austrian energy grid mix. The contextualisation with the literature shows better performance in comparison to existing building standards, yet no reduction is achieved compared to buildings with similar nZEB ambitions. The measured end-energy analysis shows that two-thirds (68%) of the operational GHG emissions are allocated to building-integrated systems, i.e., those regulated by today's EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Almost a third (30%) of the operational GHG emissions can be allocated to non-integrated systems, currently being reported as optional in the latest draft of the standard EN15978.

Transmission dynamics of the 2016-18 outbreak of hepatitis A among men who have sex with men in England and cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccination strategies to prevent future outbreaks,/articles/transmission-dynamics-2016-18-outbreak-hepatitis-among-men-who-have-sex-men-england-and,"This Article supports SDG 3 by analysing two vaccination strategies for hepatitis A outbreaks in men who have sex with men: pre-emptive (before an outbreak occurs) and reactive (once an outbreak has started). The study shows that both strategies can be cost-saving, but pre-emptive vaccination can save more money, suggesting that a pre-emptive strategy should be the first choice, and reactive used if the pre-emptive vaccination fails to prevent the outbreak.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Despite being vaccine-preventable, hepatitis A virus (HAV) outbreaks occur among men who have sex with men (MSM). We modelled the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies to prevent future outbreaks. Methods: A HAV transmission model was calibrated to HAV outbreak data for MSM in England over 2016-2018, producing estimates for the basic reproduction number (R0) and immunity levels (seroprevalence) post-outbreak. For a hypothetical outbreak in 2023 (same R0 and evolving immunity), the cost-effectiveness of pre-emptive (vaccination between outbreaks among MSM attending sexual health services (SHS)) and reactive (vaccination during outbreak among MSM attending SHS and primary care) vaccination strategies were modelled. Effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs were estimated (2017 UK pounds) from a societal perspective (10-year time horizon; 3% discount rate). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated. Findings: R0 for the 2016-2018 outbreak was 3·19 (95% credibility interval (95%CrI) 2·87-3·46); seroprevalence among MSM increased to 70·4% (95%CrI 67·3-72·8%) post-outbreak. For our hypothetical HAV outbreak in 2023, pre-emptively vaccinating MSM over the preceding five-years was cost-saving (compared to no vaccination) if the yearly vaccine coverage rate among MSM attending SHS was <9·1%. Reactive vaccination was also cost-saving compared to no vaccination, but was dominated by pre-emptive vaccination if the yearly vaccination rate was >8%. If the pre-emptive yearly vaccination rate fell below this threshold, it became cost-saving to add reactive vaccination to pre-emptive vaccination. Interpretation: Although highly transmissible, existing immunity limited the recent HAV outbreak among MSM in England. Pre-emptive vaccination between outbreaks, with reactive vaccination if indicated, is the best strategy for limiting future HAV outbreaks.

We test for the mechanisms of the commute-depression link and find that commute is associated with depression as a direct stressor rather than triggering higher work stress. When decomposing commute time into mode-specific time, we found that time on mopeds/motorcycles has the strongest association with depression.

Here we report the prediction of ventilation distributions from MBW data using a mathematical model, and the comparison of these predictions with imaging data. Methods: We developed computer simulations of the ventilation distribution in the lungs to model MBW measurement with 3 parameters: σV, determining the extent of VH; V0, the lung volume; and VD, the dead-space volume. These were inferred for each individual from supine MBW data recorded from 25 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) using approximate Bayesian computation. The fitted models were used to predict the distribution of gas imaged by 3He ventilation MRI measurements collected from the same visit. Results: The MRI indices measured (I1/3, the fraction of pixels below one-third of the mean intensity and ICV, the coefficient of variation of pixel intensity) correlated strongly with those predicted by the MBW model fits (r=0.93,0.88 respectively).

This study is to characterize a patent probiotic bacteria Enterococcus durans A8–1, capable of reducing selenite (Se6+ or Se4+) to elemental selenium (Se0) with the formation of Se nanoparticles (SeNPs).
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background
	Elemental selenium, a new type of selenium supplement, can be biosynthesized via microorganisms. This study is to characterize a patent probiotic bacteria Enterococcus durans A8–1, capable of reducing selenite (Se6+ or Se4+) to elemental selenium (Se0) with the formation of Se nanoparticles (SeNPs).
	Methods
	The selenium nanoparticles synthesized from A8–1 were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron energy (XPS). The Caco2 cells were used to investigate the effects of Se-enriched A8–1 on the viability, membrane integrity, and the regulation of cellular inflammation through MTT and ELISA assays. The selenium-enriched metabolic function of A8–1 was analyzed by transcriptome sequencing.
	Results
	E. durans A8–1 has the ability to synthesize intracellular SeNPs that are incubated with 60 mg/L sodium selenite for 18 h at 37 °C with 7 % inoculum under aerobic conditions. The selenium-enriched transformation rate increased to 43.46 %. After selenium enrichment, there were no significant morphological changes in E. durans A8–1 cells. The cells also exhibited no cytotoxicity when incubated with Caco-2 cells, and increased cellular proliferation. Furthermore, Se-enriched A8–1 cells antagonize the adhesion of S. typhimurium ATCC14028 onto the surface of Caco-2 cells protecting cell membrane integrity and was assessed by measuring LDH and AKP activities (P <0.001, P <0.001). Moreover, Se-enriched A8–1 could protect Caco-2 cells from inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide and help the cells alleviate the inflammation through the reduced expression of cytokine IL-8 (P = 0.0012, P <0.001) and TNF-α (P <0.001, P <0.001). Based on transcriptome sequencing in Se-enriched E. durans A8–1 cells, there were 485 up-regulated genes and 322 down-regulated genes (Padj < 0.05). There were 19 predicted up-regulated genes that are highly related to the potential selenium metabolism pathway, which focuses on the transportation of Na2SeO3 by membrane proteins, and gradually reduces Na2SeO3 to elemental selenium aggregates that are deposited onto the membrane surface via the intracellular redox response.
	Conclusion
	E. durans A8–1 could convert extracellular selenite into intracellular biological SeNPs via redox pathway with strong selenium-rich metabolism, and its biological SeNPs have anti-inflammatory properties, which have the potential for the development of composite selenium nanomaterials and can be further studied for the function of SeNPs with potential applications.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ethical and economic implications of the adoption of novel plant-based beef substitutes in the USA: a general equilibrium modelling study,/articles/ethical-and-economic-implications-adoption-novel-plant-based-beef-substitutes-usa-general,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 13 by showing that plant-based beef alternatives could reduce the carbon footprint of the US food system, but highlights that reductions in other envirnmental dimensions are dependent on repurposing of resources.",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background: Slowing climate change is crucial to the future wellbeing of human societies and the greater environment. Current beef production systems in the USA are a major source of negative environmental impacts and raise various animal welfare concerns. Nevertheless, beef production provides a food source high in protein and many nutrients as well as providing employment and income to millions of people. Cattle farming also contributes to individual and community identities and regional food cultures. Novel plant-based meat alternatives have been promoted as technologies that could transform the food system by reducing negative environmental, animal welfare, and health effects of meat production and consumption. Recent studies have conducted static analyses of shifts in diets globally and in the USA, but have not considered how the whole food system would respond to these changes, nor the ethical implications of these responses. We aimed to better explore these dynamics within the US food system and contribute a multiple perspective ethical assessment of plant-based alternatives to beef. Methods: In this national modelling analysis, we explored multiple ethical perspectives and the implications of the adoption of plant-based alternatives to beef in the USA. We developed USAGE-Food, a modified version of USAGE (a detailed computable general equilibrium model of the US economy), by improving the representation of sector interactions and dependencies, and consumer behaviour to better reflect resource use across the food system and the substitutability of foods within households. We further extended USAGE, by linking estimates of the environmental footprint of US agriculture, to estimate how changes across the agriculture sector could alter the environmental impact of primary food production across the whole sector, not only the beef sector. Using USAGE-Food, we simulated four beef replacement scenarios against a baseline of current beef demand in the USA: BEEF10, in which beef expenditure is replaced by other foods and three scenarios wherein 10%, 30%, or 60% of beef expenditure is replaced by plant-based alternatives. Findings: The adoption of plant-based beef alternatives is likely to reduce the carbon footprint of US food production by 2·5–13·5%, by reducing the number of animals needed for beef production by 2–12 million. Impacts on other dimensions are more ambiguous, as the agricultural workforce and natural resources, such as water and cropland, are reallocated across the food system. The shifting allocation of resources should lead to a more efficient food system, but could facilitate the expansion of other animal value chains (eg, pork and poultry) and increased exports of agricultural products. In aggregate, these changes across the food system would have a small, potentially positive, impact on national gross domestic product. However, they would lead to substantial disruptions within the agricultural economy, with the cattle and beef processing sectors decreasing by 7–45%, challenging the livelihoods of the more than 1·5 million people currently employed in beef value chains (primary production and animal processing) in the USA. Interpretation: Economic modelling suggests that the adoption of plant-based beef alternatives can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the food system. Relocation of resources across the food system, simulated by our dynamic modelling approach, might mitigate gains across other environmental dimensions (ie, water or chemical use) and might facilitate the growth of other animal value chains. Although economic consequences at the country level are small, there would be concentrated losses within the beef value chain. Reduced carbon footprint and increased resource use efficiency of the food system are reasons for policy makers to encourage the continued development of these technologies. Despite this positive outcome, policy makers should recognise the ethical assessment of these transitions will be complex, and should remain vigilant to negative outcomes and be prepared to target policies to minimise the worst effects.

The effects of night-time warming on mortality burden under future climate change scenarios: a modelling study,/articles/effects-night-time-warming-mortality-burden-under-future-climate-change-scenarios-modelling,"An Article in support of SDGs 3 and 13, projecting the possible future mortality burden due to hot nights, rather than quanitfying the effects of average daily temperatures
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background
	The health impacts of climate warming are usually quantified based on daily average temperatures. However, extra health risks might result from hot nights. We project the future mortality burden due to hot nights.
	Methods
	We selected the hot night excess (HNE) to represent the intensity of night-time heat, which was calculated as the excess sum of high temperature during night time. We collected historical mortality data in 28 cities from three east Asian countries, from 1981 to 2010. The associations between HNE and mortality in each city were firstly examined using a generalised additive model in combination with a distributed lag non-linear model over lag 0–10 days. We then pooled the cumulative associations using a univariate meta-regression model at the national or regional levels. Historical and future hourly temperature series were projected under two scenarios of greenhouse-gas emissions from 1980–2099, with ten general circulation models. We then projected the attributable fraction of mortality due to HNE under each scenario.
	Findings
	Our dataset comprised 28 cities across three countries (Japan, South Korea, and China), including 9 185 598 deaths. The time-series analyses showed the HNE was significantly associated with increased mortality risks, the relative mortality risk on days with hot nights could be 50% higher than on days with non-hot nights. Compared with the rise in daily mean temperature (lower than 20%), the frequency of hot nights would increase more than 30% and the intensity of hot night would increase by 50% by 2100s. The attributable fraction of mortality due to hot nights was projected to be 3·68% (95% CI 1·20 to 6·17) under a strict emission control scenario (SSP126). Under a medium emission control scenario (SSP245), the attributable fraction of mortality was projected to increase up to 5·79% (2·07 to 9·52), which is 0·95% (−0·39 to 2·29) more than the attributable fraction of mortality due to daily mean temperature.
	Interpretation
	Our study provides evidence for significant mortality risks and burden in association with night-time warming across Japan, South Korea, and China. Our findings suggest a growing role of night-time warming in heat-related health effects in a changing climate.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 2: Zero hunger,"Background: Indigenous communities in India have diets that do not fulfill all of their minimum nutritional requirements. Given the unaffordability of healthy diets, these communities rely on common-pool resources to make up for shortfalls in food. Yet, such foods are devalued as ""backward,""and accessing them is regulated by unequal gendered roles. Objectives: To explore the central role of community participation in documenting and transmitting indigenous knowledge about the role of locally available foods in improving dietary diversity. Methods: Through a participatory action research approach, 10 Santhal youth were trained to make films about a range of locally available foods and other issues of concern to them (Santhal/Santal is a native ethnic group in India). These films were broadcast on a YouTube channel and screened locally. A thematic content analysis of 49 films was undertaken, alongside interviews with the filmmakers and focus group discussions with viewers who attended 4 film screenings. Results: A majority of the films produced drew on intergenerational and indigenous knowledge about edible plants, insects, and rodents; skills in foraging and preparing food; awareness of the benefits of the food; and sustainability issues across the traditional food systems. The filmmakers initially focused on responding to community needs and showcasing Santhal cultural practices. Their later films began to reflect on aspects of their culture that needed to be preserved, revived, or modified. Audiences noted the relatability and relevance of the provided information, generated ideas and priority themes for further documentation, and expressed the need for revival and modification of certain cultural food practices.

Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β pathology in the lens of the eye,/articles/alzheimers-disease-amyloid-%CE%B2-pathology-lens-eye,"This research provides the first evidence of AD-related Aβ pathology outside the brain. Lens Aβ can be noninvasively measured in vivo for early AD detection and monitoring.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include pathogenic accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and age-dependent formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. AD-associated Aβ neuropathology begins decades before onset of cognitive symptoms and slowly progresses over the course of the disease. We previously reported discovery of Aβ deposition, β-amyloidopathy, and co-localizing supranuclear cataracts (SNC) in lenses from people with AD, but not other neurodegenerative disorders or normal aging. We confirmed AD-associated Aβ molecular pathology in the lens by immunohistopathology, amyloid histochemistry, immunoblot analysis, epitope mapping, immunogold electron microscopy, quantitative immunoassays, and tryptic digest mass spectrometry peptide sequencing. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that AD-associated Aβ deposits in AD lenses localize as electron-dense microaggregates in the cytoplasm of supranuclear (deep cortex) fiber cells. These Aβ microaggregates also contain αB-crystallin and scatter light, thus linking Aβ pathology and SNC phenotype expression in the lenses of people with AD. Subsequent research identified Aβ lens pathology as the molecular origin of the distinctive cataracts associated with Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21), a chromosomal disorder invariantly associated with early-onset Aβ accumulation and Aβ amyloidopathy in the brain. Investigation of 1249 participants in the Framingham Eye Study found that AD-associated quantitative traits in brain and lens are co-heritable. Moreover, AD-associated lens traits preceded MRI brain traits and cognitive deficits by a decade or more and predicted future AD. A genome-wide association study of bivariate outcomes in the same subjects identified a new AD risk factor locus in the CTNND2 gene encoding δ-catenin, a protein that modulates Aβ production in brain and lens. Here we report identification of AD-related human Aβ (hAβ) lens pathology and age-dependent SNC phenotype expression in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD. Tg2576 mice express Swedish mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP-Swe), accumulate hAβ peptides and amyloid pathology in the brain, and exhibit cognitive deficits that slowly progress with increasing age. We found that Tg2576 trangenic (Tg+) mice, but not non-transgenic (Tg–) control mice, also express human APP, accumulate hAβ peptides, and develop hAβ molecular and ultrastructural pathologies in the lens. Tg2576 Tg+ mice exhibit age-dependent Aβ supranuclear lens opacification that recapitulates lens pathology and SNC phenotype expression in human AD. In addition, we detected hAβ in conditioned medium from lens explant cultures prepared from Tg+ mice, but not Tg– control mice, a finding consistent with constitutive hAβ generation in the lens. In vitro studies showed that hAβ promoted mouse lens protein aggregation detected by quasi-elastic light scattering (QLS) spectroscopy. These results support mechanistic (genotype-phenotype) linkage between Aβ pathology and AD-related phenotypes in lens and brain. Collectively, our findings identify Aβ pathology as the shared molecular etiology of two age-dependent AD-related cataracts associated with two human diseases (AD, DS) and homologous murine cataracts in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD. These results represent the first evidence of AD-related Aβ pathology outside the brain and point to lens Aβ as an optically-accessible AD biomarker for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of this devastating neurodegenerative disease.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Trans-urocanic acid (trans-UCA) is an isomer of cis-UCA and is widely distributed in the brain, predominantly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have investigated the role of trans-UCA in non-spatial memory; however, its influence on spatial memory remains unclear. In the present study, network pharmacology strategy and behavioral testing were used to evaluate the role of trans-UCA in spatial memory and predict its possible mechanism. The results showed that there are 40 intersecting targets between trans-UCA and spatial memory identified by several databases and Venn diagram, indicating that trans-UCA may be involved in spatial memory. Behavioral results show that trans-UCA facilitates spatial working memory in the Y-maze test as well as spatial recognition memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in an object location recognition (OLR) task. Furthermore, PPI (protein-protein interaction) network analysis, GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathway enrichment analyses show that the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancing effect of trans-UCA on spatial memory are mainly associated with the regulation of insulin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways, serotonergic synapse and arginine and proline metabolism.

Predominant barriers for MDC are fragmentation of health services, being understaffed, inadequate infrastructure, and geographic disparities. Access to MDC varies widely in the region, with significant heterogeneity documented within countries. MDC practice was described as being more common in the private sector in Ecuador and Uruguay, while it is more widely implemented in public institutions of Colombia and Bolivia. Interpretation: Establishing quality MDC remains a challenge for oncology practices in Latin America. Addressing regional issues and identifying specific local needs is warranted to encourage the adoption of an effective multidisciplinary approach and, consequently, improve clinical outcomes. Active involvement of all stakeholders is required to build locally solutions and should involve institutions, health professionals, and patients.

"Outsourcing health-care services to the private sector and treatable mortality rates in England, 2013–20: an observational study of NHS privatisation",/articles/outsourcing-health-care-services-private-sector-and-treatable-mortality-rates-england-2013,"This Article supports SDG 3 by assessing the impact of the private outsourcing of NHS services in England, finding that rates of treatable mortality increased as outsourcing increased.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The effects of outsourcing health services to for-profit providers are contested, with some arguing that introducing such providers will improve performance through additional competition while others worry that this will lead to cost cutting and poorer outcomes for patients. We aimed to examine this debate by empirically evaluating the impact of outsourced spending to private providers, following the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, on treatable mortality rates and the quality of health-care services in England. Methods: For this observational study, we used a novel database composed of parsable procurement contracts between April 1, 2013, and Feb 29, 2020 (n=645 674, value >£25 000, total value £204·1 billion), across 173 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs; regional health boards) in England. Data were compiled from 12 709 heterogenous expenditure files primarily scraped from commissioner websites with supplier names matched to registers identifying them as National Health Service (NHS) organisations, for-profit companies, or charities. We supplemented these data with rates of local mortality from causes that should be treatable by medical intervention, indicating the quality of health-care services. We used multivariate longitudinal regression models with fixed effects at the CCG level to analyse the association of for-profit outsourcing on treatable mortality rates in the following year. We used the average marginal effects to estimate total additional deaths attributable to changes in for-profit outsourcing. We provided alternative model specifications to test the robustness of our findings, match on background characteristics, examine the potential impact of measurement error, and adjust for possible confounding factors such as population demographics, total CCG expenditure, and local authority expenditure. Findings: We found that an annual increase of one percentage point of outsourcing to the private for-profit sector corresponded with an annual increase in treatable mortality of 0·38% (95% CI 0·22–0·55; p=0·0016) or 0·29 (95% CI 0·09–0·49; p=0·0041) deaths per 100 000 population in the following year. This finding was robust to matching on background characteristics, adjusting for possible confounding factors, and measurement error in our dataset. Changes to for-profit outsourcing since 2014 were associated with an additional 557 (95% CI 153–961) treatable deaths across the 173 CCGs. Interpretation: The privatisation of the NHS in England, through the outsourcing of services to for-profit companies, consistently increased in 2013–20. Private sector outsourcing corresponded with significantly increased rates of treatable mortality, potentially as a result of a decline in the quality of health-care services.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities,"Wales's climate is predicted to be warmer and wetter, and ‘hot’ summers are expected to become more commonplace by the middle of this century. Whilst the focus of climate change adaptation in Wales has been wintertime decarbonisation through the introduction of energy efficiency measures, Welsh Government now want to understand the summertime impacts of climate change on the occupants of Welsh housing. The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that summertime indoor housing conditions in Wales will diminish as a consequence of climate change. A six-week period from 22nd July–31st August was modelled using UK 2018 local climate projections, baseline, 2030 and 2070 respectively. The results reveal increased incidences of summertime overheating in a majority of dwellings. The poorest performing dwellings were post 1990 dwellings, flats and properties with internal wall insulation. The results show that cooling strategies to reduce indoor air temperature will increasingly be required. The other indoor vulnerability modelled was that of moisture. Results demonstrate the potential for poorer indoor environmental quality due to increased relative humidity. Every location will experience increases in relative humidity regardless of dwelling typology. Relative humidity will be highest in pre-1919 dwellings and dwellings with solid stone walls. The results show that ventilation strategies to improve the extraction of moisture-laden air, whilst diluting the concentration of pollutants that are present indoors, are required if these dwellings are to avoid increased incidences of condensation, damp, and mould growth, and adverse impacts from other allergens, particles and pollutants.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In this Viewpoint, we seek to consolidate thinking around how public health can counter and proactively minimise powerful commercial influences. We propose an initial eight strategies for this public health playbook: expand public health training and coalitions, increase public sector resources, link with and learn from social movements to foster collective solidarity, protect public health advocates from industry threats, develop and implement rigorous conflict of interest safeguards, monitor and expose corporate activities, debunk corporate arguments, and leverage diverse commercial interests. This set of strategies seeks to amplify inherent assets of the public health community and create opportunities to explicitly counter the corporate playbook.

The personal economic burden of dementia in Europe,/articles/personal-economic-burden-dementia-europe,"A Comment on dementia and Alzheimer's disease costs, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the costs of care in Europe.
Dementia is a syndrome characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment, most commonly caused by Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders. Costs of care increase dramatically with progressing disease severity, and increasing dementia prevalence due to ageing populations is raising concerns about the sustainability of future costs of dementia care. A new study shows that social welfare systems in Europe cover most of the direct costs of dementia, however they do not protect families and households against the burden of informal care. Meier and colleagues1 set out to calculate the economic costs of dementia in 11 European countries, by combining microdata from a population-based survey with estimates of dementia prevalence. Data for Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden was obtained from six waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The survey captured out-of-pocket expenditures for health and social care as well as unpaid informal care. Costs attributable to dementia were estimated using linear regression, controlling for comorbidities and demographic factors. Finally, costs were combined with prevalence estimates to calculate the annual cost of dementia by country.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land,"The role of nature restoration in mitigating the impacts of climate change is receiving increasing attention, yet the mitigation potential is often assessed in terms of carbon removal rather than the ability to meet temperature goals, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement. Here, we estimate the global removal potential from nature restoration constrained by a “responsible development” framework and the contribution this would make to a 1.5°C temperature limit. Our constrained restoration options result in a median of 103 GtC (5%–95% range of −91 to 196 GtC) in cumulative removals between 2020 and 2100. When combined with deep-decarbonization scenarios, our restoration scenario briefly exceeds 1.5°C before declining to between 1.25°C and 1.5°C by 2100 (median, 50% probability). We conclude that additional carbon sequestration via nature restoration is unlikely to be done quickly enough to notably reduce the global peak temperatures expected in the next few decades.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: WHO has established a Global Clinical Platform for the clinical characterisation of COVID-19 among hospitalised individuals. We assessed whether people living with HIV hospitalised with COVID-19 had increased odds of severe presentation and of in-hospital mortality compared with individuals who were HIV-negative and associated risk factors. Methods: Between Jan 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021, anonymised individual-level data from 338 566 patients in 38 countries were reported to WHO. Using the Platform pooled dataset, we performed descriptive statistics and regression analyses to compare outcomes in the two populations and identify risk factors. Findings: Of 197 479 patients reporting HIV status, 16 955 (8·6%) were people living with HIV. 16 283 (96.0%) of the 16 955 people living with HIV were from Africa; 10 603 (62·9%) were female and 6271 (37·1%) were male; the mean age was 45·5 years (SD 13·7); 6339 (38·3%) were admitted to hospital with severe illness; and 3913 (24·3%) died in hospital. Of the 10 166 people living with HIV with known antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, 9302 (91·5%) were on ART. Compared with individuals without HIV, people living with HIV had 15% increased odds of severe presentation with COVID-19 (aOR 1·15, 95% CI 1·10–1·20) and were 38% more likely to die in hospital (aHR 1·38, 1·34–1·41). Among people living with HIV, male sex, age 45–75 years, and having chronic cardiac disease or hypertension increased the odds of severe COVID-19; male sex, age older than 18 years, having diabetes, hypertension, malignancy, tuberculosis, or chronic kidney disease increased the risk of in-hospital mortality. The use of ART or viral load suppression were associated with a reduced risk of poor outcomes; however, HIV infection remained a risk factor for severity and mortality regardless of ART and viral load suppression status. Interpretation: In this sample of hospitalised people contributing data to the WHO Global Clinical Platform for COVID-19, HIV was an independent risk factor for both severe COVID-19 at admission and in-hospital mortality. These findings have informed WHO immunisation policy that prioritises vaccination for people living with HIV.

We aimed to provide up-to-date estimates on the burden of disease attributable to WASH and on the effects of different types of WASH interventions on childhood diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated previous reviews following their search strategy by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and BIOSIS Citation Index for studies of basic WASH interventions and of WASH interventions providing a high level of service, published between Jan 1, 2016, and May 25, 2021. We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials conducted at household or community level that matched exposure categories of the so-called service ladder approach of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for WASH. Two reviewers independently extracted study-level data and assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and certainty of evidence using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We analysed extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016043164. Findings: 19 837 records were identified from the search, of which 124 studies were included, providing 83 water (62 616 children), 20 sanitation (40 799 children), and 41 hygiene (98 416 children) comparisons. Compared with untreated water from an unimproved source, risk of diarrhoea was reduced by up to 50% with water treated at point of use (POU): filtration (n=23 studies; RR 0·50 [95% CI 0·41–0·60]), solar treatment (n=13; 0·63 [0·50–0·80]), and chlorination (n=25; 0·66 [0·56–0·77]). Compared with an unimproved source, provision of an improved drinking water supply on premises with higher water quality reduced diarrhoea risk by 52% (n=2; 0·48 [0·26–0·87]). Overall, sanitation interventions reduced diarrhoea risk by 24% (0·76 [0·61–0·94]). Compared with unimproved sanitation, providing sewer connection reduced diarrhoea risk by 47% (n=5; 0·53 [0·30–0·93]). Promotion of handwashing with soap reduced diarrhoea risk by 30% (0·70 [0·64–0·76]). Interpretation: WASH interventions reduced risk of diarrhoea in children in LMICs. Interventions supplying either water filtered at POU, higher water quality from an improved source on premises, or basic sanitation services with sewer connection were associated with increased reductions. Our results support higher service levels called for under SDG 6. Notably, no studies evaluated interventions that delivered access to safely managed WASH services, the level of service to which universal coverage by 2030 is committed under the SDG.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global health problem and China has the largest disease burden. Literatures focusing on economic-related inequalities in HBV infection among pregnant women are scarce. We aimed to quantify the economic-related inequalities and the change over time in HBV infection among pregnant women in mainland China from 2013 to 2020 to inform strategies considering economic-related inequalities. Methods: We used national cross-sectional secondary data of pregnant women in 30 provinces from the National Integrated Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B Programme (iPMTCT Programme) from 2013 to 2020. We calculated concentration index and adjusted difference between the rich and the poor in the multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to measure economic-related inequality, after adjusted other risk factors. Findings: In this study, a total of 115,789,148 pregnant women of mainland China from 2013 to 2020 were included, the overall hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence was 6.27% (95%CI: 6.26%-6.28%). The curve lay above the equality line, with the negative value of the concentration index of -0.027, which indicated that economic-related health disparities exist in the distribution of HBV infection and the inequality disadvantageous to the poor (pro-poor). The concentration index showed a trend of fluctuating decline, indicating that economic-related inequalities in HBsAg prevalence were narrowing. The adjust difference between counties with lowest economic level and counties with highest economic level (reference group) were 46.3% in HBsAg prevalence (all p<0.05) in the multivariable GEE model, after controlling other confounders. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between low economic level and high HBsAg prevalence that the adjust difference increased from 15.6% (aOR=1.156, 95% CI: 1.064–1.257) in the high-economic group to 46.3% (aOR=1.463, 95% CI: 1.294–1.824) in the lowest-economic group, compared with the highest-economic group. The association between low economic level and high HBsAg prevalence was stable in the sensitivity analysis. Interpretation: HBV infection was more concentrated among population with lower economic status. Economic-related inequalities in HBV infection decreased in the past decade. Our findings highlight the importance of developing equity-oriented policies and targeted interventions to reduce HBV infection among the poor and hard-to-reach populations to achieve the 2030 HBV elimination goals on time.

We use a monthly household panel dataset that covers a period both before and after the outbreak began to examine the impact of COVID-19 on daily mobility and household welfare in Tajikistan. The feature of our dataset is that it contains information on daily mobility for those traveling by vehicle along with their travel purposes. We provide several new findings. First, the impact of the pandemic on daily mobility was limited in Tajikistan, in contrast with the evidence from other countries. The pandemic discouraged motorized travel for family-related purposes in all income groups while keeping other vehicle travel intact for reasons such as work and shopping under the country’s lenient travel restrictions. Second, the effects of concerns about the pandemic were not uniform across all vehicle travel when different purposes are taken into account. People who were very concerned about the pandemic were more likely to refrain from motorized travel for family-related purposes. Third, refraining from travel for family purposes exacerbated food insecurity, implying that the safety net provided by family members and relatives was hampered by the limited ability to travel during the pandemic.

Higher rates of contraceptive coverage have been linked to the availability of a more diverse range of contraceptive methods. We present estimates of the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR), modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), demand satisfied, and the method of contraception used for both partnered and unpartnered women for 5-year age groups in 204 countries and territories between 1970 and 2019. Methods: We used 1162 population-based surveys capturing contraceptive use among women between 1970 and 2019, in which women of reproductive age (15–49 years) self-reported their, or their partner's, current use of contraception for family planning purposes. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to generate estimates of the CPR, mCPR, demand satisfied, and method mix by age and marital status. We assessed how age-specific mCPR and demand satisfied changed with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of social and economic development, using the meta-regression Bayesian, regularised, trimmed method from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. Findings: In 2019, 162·9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 155·6–170·2) women had unmet need for contraception, of whom 29·3% (27·9–30·6) resided in sub-Saharan Africa and 27·2% (24·4–30·3) resided in south Asia. Women aged 15–19 years (64·8% [62·9–66·7]) and 20–24 years (71·9% [68·9–74·2]) had the lowest rates of demand satisfied, with 43·2 million (95% UI 39·3–48·0) women aged 15–24 years with unmet need in 2019. The mCPR and demand satisfied among women aged 15–19 years were substantially lower than among women aged 20–49 years at SDI values below 60 (on a 0–100 scale), but began to equalise as SDI increased above 60. Between 1970 and 2019, the global mCPR increased by 20·1 percentage points (95% UI 18·7–21·6). During this time, traditional methods declined as a proportion of all contraceptive methods, whereas the use of implants, injections, female sterilisation, and condoms increased. Method mix differs substantially depending on age and geography, with the share of female sterilisation increasing with age and comprising more than 50% of methods in use in south Asia. In 28 countries, one method was used by more than 50% of users in 2019. Interpretation: The dominance of one contraceptive method in some locations raises the question of whether family planning policies should aim to expand method mix or invest in making existing methods more accessible. Lower rates of demand satisfied among women aged 15–24 years are also concerning because unintended pregnancies before age 25 years can forestall or eliminate education and employment opportunities that lead to social and economic empowerment. Policy makers should strive to tailor family planning programmes to the preferences of the groups with the most need, while maintaining the programmes used by existing users.

In this paper, we examine how social networks prior to the pandemic helped to shape health beliefs, behaviors, and outcomes among older adults during its onset, focusing on (1) perceived risk of COVID-19, (2) preventative health behaviors, and (3) mental health, including loneliness, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. Drawing on the longitudinal Social Networks in Alzheimer Disease study, we find that networks high in bridging social capital predict greater perceived risk and more precautions taken, but worse mental health. In contrast, networks high in bonding social capital predict less perceived risk and fewer precautions taken, but better mental health.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for early detection of skin cancer in community and primary care settings: a systematic review,/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-algorithms-early-detection-skin-cancer,"This Review supports SDG 3 by evaluating artificial intelligence algorithms for skin cancer detection in a primary care setting. The Review focuses on the accuracy of these algorithms and highlights several areas of concern in how they are assessed, proposing a checklist to help design, evaluate, and implement new algorithms.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Skin cancers occur commonly worldwide. The prognosis and disease burden are highly dependent on the cancer type and disease stage at diagnosis. We systematically reviewed studies on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms that aim to facilitate the early diagnosis of skin cancers, focusing on their application in primary and community care settings. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science (from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 9, 2021) for all studies providing evidence on applying AI/ML algorithms to the early diagnosis of skin cancer, including all study designs and languages. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of the algorithms for skin cancers. The secondary outcomes included an overview of AI/ML methods, evaluation approaches, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to patients and clinicians. We identified 14 224 studies. Only two studies used data from clinical settings with a low prevalence of skin cancers. We reported data from all 272 studies that could be relevant in primary care. The primary outcomes showed reasonable mean diagnostic accuracy for melanoma (89·5% [range 59·7–100%]), squamous cell carcinoma (85·3% [71·0–97·8%]), and basal cell carcinoma (87·6% [70·0–99·7%]). The secondary outcomes showed a heterogeneity of AI/ML methods and study designs, with high amounts of incomplete reporting (eg, patient demographics and methods of data collection). Few studies used data on populations with a low prevalence of skin cancers to train and test their algorithms; therefore, the widespread adoption into community and primary care practice cannot currently be recommended until efficacy in these populations is shown. We did not identify any health economic, patient, or clinician acceptability data for any of the included studies.

Abortion travel within the United States: An observational study of cross-state movement to obtain abortion care in 2017,/articles/abortion-travel-within-united-states-observational-study-cross-state-movement-obtain,"This Article supports SDG 3 by assessing the association between people leaving state in the USA for an abortion and the availalble facilities and state legislation. THe findings showed that the proportion of people leaving the state varied widely by state, and that this was affected by state-level abortion policy and facility scarcity.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: In the United States, abortion access is often more limited for people who live in states with few abortion facilities and restrictive abortion legislation. Pregnant people seeking an abortion thus often travel to access care. Methods: We calculated state-specific abortion rate (number of abortions per thousand women ages 15 to 44) and percentage of patients leaving for abortion care using CDC 2017 Abortion Surveillance data, the Guttmacher Institute's Abortion Provider Census and Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States report, and US Census data. We categorized percent leaving by abortion policy landscape using the Guttmacher Institute's classification of state abortion laws, and by facility density (number of abortion facilities per million women ages 15 to 44), calculated using Census and Guttmacher data. We ran correlational tests between each of our variables (percent leaving, facility density, and policy environment), as well as between percent leaving and facility density within policy environment. Findings: In 2017, an average of 8% of US patients left their state of residence for abortion care. Percent leaving varied widely by state: 74% left Wyoming, 57% left South Carolina, and 56% left Missouri, while 13 states had fewer than 4% of patients leaving. States with more restrictive laws averaged 12% of patients leaving, while states with middle ground or supportive laws averaged 10% and 3% leaving, respectively. Pairwise correlations between percent leaving, facility density, and policy score were all statistically significant, though correlations between percent leaving and facility density within policy environment were not. Interpretation: Many patients travel across state lines for abortion care. While patients may leave for a range of reasons, restrictive state-level abortion policy and facility scarcity are associated with patients leaving their state of residence.

Measuring the availability of human resources for health and its relationship to universal health coverage for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,/articles/measuring-availability-human-resources-health-and-its-relationship-universal-health,"This paper supports SDG 3 by highlighting that considerable expansion of the world's health workforce is needed to achieve high levels of UHC effective coverage. The largest shortages are in low-income settings, highlighting the need for increased financing and coordination to train, employ, and retain human resources in the health sector.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Human resources for health (HRH) include a range of occupations that aim to promote or improve human health. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the WHO Health Workforce 2030 strategy have drawn attention to the importance of HRH for achieving policy priorities such as universal health coverage (UHC). Although previous research has found substantial global disparities in HRH, the absence of comparable cross-national estimates of existing workforces has hindered efforts to quantify workforce requirements to meet health system goals. We aimed to use comparable and standardised data sources to estimate HRH densities globally, and to examine the relationship between a subset of HRH cadres and UHC effective coverage performance. Methods: Through the International Labour Organization and Global Health Data Exchange databases, we identified 1404 country-years of data from labour force surveys and 69 country-years of census data, with detailed microdata on health-related employment. From the WHO National Health Workforce Accounts, we identified 2950 country-years of data. We mapped data from all occupational coding systems to the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO-88), allowing for standardised estimation of densities for 16 categories of health workers across the full time series. Using data from 1990 to 2019 for 196 of 204 countries and territories, covering seven Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) super-regions and 21 regions, we applied spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) to model HRH densities from 1990 to 2019 for all countries and territories. We used stochastic frontier meta-regression to model the relationship between the UHC effective coverage index and densities for the four categories of health workers enumerated in SDG indicator 3.c.1 pertaining to HRH: physicians, nurses and midwives, dentistry personnel, and pharmaceutical personnel. We identified minimum workforce density thresholds required to meet a specified target of 80 out of 100 on the UHC effective coverage index, and quantified national shortages with respect to those minimum thresholds. Findings: We estimated that, in 2019, the world had 104·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 83·5–128·0) health workers, including 12·8 million (9·7–16·6) physicians, 29·8 million (23·3–37·7) nurses and midwives, 4·6 million (3·6–6·0) dentistry personnel, and 5·2 million (4·0–6·7) pharmaceutical personnel. We calculated a global physician density of 16·7 (12·6–21·6) per 10 000 population, and a nurse and midwife density of 38·6 (30·1–48·8) per 10 000 population. We found the GBD super-regions of sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and north Africa and the Middle East had the lowest HRH densities. To reach 80 out of 100 on the UHC effective coverage index, we estimated that, per 10 000 population, at least 20·7 physicians, 70·6 nurses and midwives, 8·2 dentistry personnel, and 9·4 pharmaceutical personnel would be needed. In total, the 2019 national health workforces fell short of these minimum thresholds by 6·4 million physicians, 30·6 million nurses and midwives, 3·3 million dentistry personnel, and 2·9 million pharmaceutical personnel. Interpretation: Considerable expansion of the world's health workforce is needed to achieve high levels of UHC effective coverage. The largest shortages are in low-income settings, highlighting the need for increased financing and coordination to train, employ, and retain human resources in the health sector. Actual HRH shortages might be larger than estimated because minimum thresholds for each cadre of health workers are benchmarked on health systems that most efficiently translate human resources into UHC attainment.

AI recognition of patient race in medical imaging: a modelling study,/articles/ai-recognition-patient-race-medical-imaging-modelling-study,This Article supports SDGs 3 and 16 by evaluating the ability of  artificial intelligence to recognise a person's racial identity from medical images.,"Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions","Background: Previous studies in medical imaging have shown disparate abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect a person's race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical imaging that would be obvious to human experts when interpreting the images. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of AI to recognise a patient's racial identity from medical images. Methods: Using private (Emory CXR, Emory Chest CT, Emory Cervical Spine, and Emory Mammogram) and public (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT, and Digital Hand Atlas) datasets, we evaluated, first, performance quantification of deep learning models in detecting race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalise to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities. Second, we assessed possible confounding of anatomic and phenotypic population features by assessing the ability of these hypothesised confounders to detect race in isolation using regression models, and by re-evaluating the deep learning models by testing them on datasets stratified by these hypothesised confounding variables. Last, by exploring the effect of image corruptions on model performance, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognise race. Findings: In our study, we show that standard AI deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities, which was sustained under external validation conditions (x-ray imaging [area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) range 0·91–0·99], CT chest imaging [0·87–0·96], and mammography [0·81]). We also showed that this detection is not due to proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race (eg, performance of possible confounders: body-mass index [AUC 0·55], disease distribution [0·61], and breast density [0·61]). Finally, we provide evidence to show that the ability of AI deep learning models persisted over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrums of the images, suggesting the efforts to control this behaviour when it is undesirable will be challenging and demand further study. Interpretation: The results from our study emphasise that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging.

Together these barriers overlap forming the “glass obstacle course”—which is particularly challenging for women in minoritized groups.

Energy Efficiency policies are necessary but not sufficient to reduce energy consumption. Energy Conservation and Energy Sufficiency Policies complement Energy Efficiency policies, together they can reduce energy demand. The article presents some existing and new policies which address sufficiency. There is the need for coherent policy package with different types of policy instruments addressing efficiency and sufficiency. 
",Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"There is a strong consent among scholars and policy makers that limiting current global energy demand and gradually reducing it towards a sustainable level of consumption is a key component of any strategies and pathways to reach the Paris Agreement climate target, and, in particular, carbon neutrality by mid-century. Given the stringency and urgency of the climate target and the current global increase of energy demand, in addition to investments in energy efficiency technologies, there is the need for a change of energy end-users behaviour and life style to obtain additional energy savings by limiting the demand for services. Traditionally, energy efficiency policies have mainly targeted and promoted energy efficient technologies (e.g., energy performance standards for vehicles, appliances and buildings, financial incentives for new technologies, etc.). In some cases, the energy savings achieved have been less than expected, due to a rebound effect, or because external factors (e.g., growth in populations or economies) have increased energy consumption. The “traditional” energy efficiency policies are still very necessary, but are not sufficient for reaching the Paris Agreement target and the rapid reduction of the energy demand. Policies focusing on energy conservation and sufficiency principles complement efficiency policies, in particular those aiming at changing end-user consumer behaviour and lifestyle by imposing some limitation to the demand for energy services. The article first reviews the concept of energy savings compared to energy efficiency and introduce the concept of energy sufficiency. Then the article explores and discusses some existing and new policy instruments that can address energy conservation and sufficiency such as: personal carbon allowances; energy/carbon taxation; progressive appliance and vehicles standards, and progressive building codes. The article's focus is mainly on individual end-users and on residential buildings.

The purpose of this study was to examine how Asian Americans’ racism and discrimination experiences were related to firearm-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021 from a national sample of 916 Asian Americans. Measures included demographics, firearm-related risks, and three measures of racism/discrimination experiences since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 38% of individual gun owners have carried a gun more frequently since the pandemic. After controlling for family firearm ownership and demographics, regression analyses showed that Asian Americans who experienced racial discrimination were more likely to purchase a gun and ammunition and intend to purchase more ammunition during the COVID-19 pandemic. AAs who perceived more cultural racism were more likely to purchase a gun. Individuals who reported higher anticipatory racism-related stress reported greater intent to purchase guns.

After the implementation of the first phase of the Ecological Project, the percentage of restored grassland area has significantly increased from 8.82% to 24.57%, and slightly decreased during the second phase. (2) The establishment of national nature reserves and the implementation of the Ecological Project have changed the situation that “the grassland inside the reserve is worse than that outside the reserve”. (3) Grassland restoration is mainly affected by the joint effects of climate and human activities. Nevertheless, grassland degradation is mainly affected by human activities such as overgrazing and grassland reclamation.

Real-world effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis in men at high risk of HIV infection in France: a nested case-control study,/articles/real-world-effectiveness-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-men-high-risk-hiv-infection-france-nested,"This Article supports SDG 3 by providing new insights on the degree and determinants of real-world PrEP effectiveness among men at risk of HIV in France, with relevance in the current context of worldwide PrEP scale up.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has shown high efficacy in clinical trials, but few observational studies have confirmed its effectiveness when prescribed in real life to users with diverse profiles. This study aimed to assess real-world PrEP effectiveness. Methods: We did a matched, nested case-control study among adult men at high risk of HIV infection between Jan 1, 2016, and June 30, 2020, using data from the French national health data system. Men who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection up to Dec 31, 2020, were individually matched with up to five controls for age, socioeconomic status, place of residence, calendar year, and follow-up duration. PrEP use was characterised on the basis of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine dispensing over time. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of PrEP use associated with HIV infection. PrEP effectiveness (computed as 1–adjusted OR), was estimated overall, by mode of PrEP use, and by individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics. Findings: Among a total of 46 706 individuals, 256 patients with HIV infection were identified and matched with 1213 controls. PrEP users accounted for 29% of cases and 49% of controls. PrEP effectiveness was 60% (95% CI 46 to 71) overall, reaching 93% (84 to 97) for a high amount of PrEP consumption, and 86% (78 to 92) if excluding periods after PrEP discontinuation. PrEP effectiveness was significantly reduced in people younger than 30 years (26% [–21 to 54]) and in those who were socioeconomically deprived (–64% [–392 to 45]), both of which groups showed low amounts of PrEP consumption and high rates of PrEP discontinuation.

Predictive value of CD8+ T cell and CD4/CD8 ratio at two years of successful ART in the risk of AIDS and non-AIDS events,/articles/predictive-value-cd8-t-cell-and-cd4cd8-ratio-two-years-successful-art-risk-aids-and-non,"This Article supports SDG 3 by investigating the role of CD8+ T cell count on suppressive ART as a predictor of clinical progression in HIV, suggesting its potential use as a clinical biomarker in evaluations of novel therapies for ongoing immune dysfunction during treated infection.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: While increased CD8 counts and low CD4/CD8 ratio during treated HIV correlate with immunosenescence, their additional predictive values to identify individuals with HIV at higher risk of clinical events remain controversial. Methods: We selected treatment-naive individuals initiating ART from ACTG studies 384, 388, A5095, A5142, A5202, and A5257 who had achieved viral suppression at year 2. We examined the effect of CD8+ T cell counts and CD4/CD8 at year 2 on the probability of AIDS and serious non-AIDS events in years 3−7. We used inverse probability weighting methods to address informative censoring, combined with multivariable logistic regression models. Findings: We analyzed 5133 participants with a median age of 38 years; 959 (19%) were female, pre-ART median CD4 counts were 249 (Q1-Q3 91–372) cell/µL. Compared to participants with CD8 counts between 500/µL and 1499/µL, those with >1500/µL had a higher risk of clinical events during years 3−7 (aOR 1.75; 95%CI 1.33−2.32). CD4/CD8 ratio was not predictive of greater risk of events through year 7. Additional analyses revealed consistent CD8 count effect sizes for the risk of AIDS events and noninfectious non-AIDS events, but opposite effects for the risk of severe infections, which were more frequent among individuals with CD8 counts <500/µL (aOR 1.70; 95%CI 1.09−2.65). Interpretation: The results of this analysis with pooled data from clinical trials support the value of the CD8 count as a predictor of clinical progression. People with very high CD8 counts during suppressive ART might benefit from closer monitoring and may be a target population for novel interventions.

Early neurodevelopment of HIV-exposed uninfected children in the era of antiretroviral therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,/articles/early-neurodevelopment-hiv-exposed-uninfected-children-era-antiretroviral-therapy,"An Article in support of SDG 3, examining the effects of in-utero exposure to HIV and ART on child neurodevelopment and highlighting the need for large high-quality longitudinal studies to assess the neurodevelopmental trajectories of HIV-exposed uninfected children and to investigate underlying mechanisms to inform intervention strategies.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: There are 15·4 million children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected worldwide. Early child development crucially influences later academic and socioeconomic factors. However, the neurodevelopmental outcomes of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children in the era of maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain unclear. We aimed to examine the effects of in-utero exposure to HIV and ART on child neurodevelopment. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Africa-Wide Information, PsycInfo, and Global Health databases from inception to May 27, 2020, for studies from the past two decades reporting neurodevelopment of HEU children aged 0–5 years compared with HIV-unexposed (HU) children (aim 1), and effects of different maternal ART regimens on neurodevelopment of HEU children (aim 2). We did narrative syntheses for both aims, and a random-effects meta-analysis of high-quality studies comparing HEU children and HU children, to obtain weighted pooled estimates of effect sizes. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018075910. Findings: We screened 35 527 records and included 45 articles from 31 studies. Overall, 12 (57%) of 21 studies comparing HEU children and HU children found worse neurodevelopment in HEU children in at least one domain. Study design and methodological quality were variable, with heterogeneity across populations. Meta-analysis included eight high-quality studies comparing 1856 HEU children with 3067 HU children at ages 12–24 months; among HEU children with available data, 1709 (99%) of 1732 were exposed to ART. HEU children had poorer expressive language (effect size –0·17 [95% CI –0·27 to –0·07], p=0·0013) and gross motor function (–0·13 [–0·20 to –0·07], p<0·0001) than HU children, but similar cognitive development (–0·06 [–0·19 to 0·06], p=0·34), receptive language development (–0·10 [–0·23 to 0·03], p=0·14), and fine motor skills (–0·05 [–0·15 to 0·06], p=0·36). Results suggested little or no evidence of an effect of specific maternal ART regimens on neurodevelopment; study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. Interpretation: HEU children are at risk of subtle impairments in expressive language and gross motor development by age 2 years. We found no consistent effect of maternal ART regimens analysed, although evidence was scarce. We highlight the need for large high-quality longitudinal studies to assess the neurodevelopmental trajectories of HEU children and to investigate underlying mechanisms to inform intervention strategies.

The seasonality of cholera in sub-Saharan Africa: a statistical modelling study,/articles/seasonality-cholera-sub-saharan-africa-statistical-modelling-study,"This Article supports SDGs 3, 6, and 13 by showing consistent and positive correlations between cholera seasonality and precipitation and, to a lesser extent, between cholera seasonality and temperature and flooding in sub-Saharan Africa.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Cholera remains a major threat in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where some of the highest case-fatality rates are reported. Knowing in what months and where cholera tends to occur across the continent could aid in improving efforts to eliminate cholera as a public health concern. However, largely due to the absence of unified large-scale datasets, no continent-wide estimates exist. In this study, we aimed to estimate cholera seasonality across SSA and explore the correlation between hydroclimatic variables and cholera seasonality. Methods: Using the global cholera database of the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, we developed statistical models to synthesise data across spatial and temporal scales to infer the seasonality of excess (defined as incidence higher than the 2010–16 mean incidence rate) suspected cholera occurrence in SSA. We developed a Bayesian statistical model to infer the monthly risk of excess cholera at the first and second administrative levels. Seasonality patterns were then grouped into spatial clusters. Finally, we studied the association between seasonality estimates and hydroclimatic variables (mean monthly fraction of area flooded, mean monthly air temperature, and cumulative monthly precipitation). Findings: 24 (71%) of the 34 countries studied had seasonal patterns of excess cholera risk, corresponding to approximately 86% of the SSA population. 12 (50%) of these 24 countries also had subnational differences in seasonality patterns, with strong differences in seasonality strength between regions. Seasonality patterns clustered into two macroregions (west Africa and the Sahel vs eastern and southern Africa), which were composed of subregional clusters with varying degrees of seasonality. Exploratory association analysis found most consistent and positive correlations between cholera seasonality and precipitation and, to a lesser extent, between cholera seasonality and temperature and flooding. Interpretation: Widespread cholera seasonality in SSA offers opportunities for intervention planning. Further studies are needed to study the association between cholera and climate.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: WHO core components for infection prevention and control (IPC) are important building blocks for effective IPC programmes. To our knowledge, we did the first WHO global survey to assess implementation of these programmes in health-care facilities. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, IPC professionals were invited through global outreach and national coordinated efforts to complete the online WHO IPC assessment framework (IPCAF). The survey was created in English and was then translated into ten languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Thai. Post-stratification weighting was applied and countries with low response rates were excluded to improve representativeness. Weighted median scores and IQRs as well as weighted proportions (Nw) meeting defined IPCAF minimum requirements were reported. Indicators associated with the IPCAF score were assessed using a generalised estimating equation. Findings: From Jan 16 to Dec 31, 2019, 4440 responses were received from 81 countries. The overall weighted IPCAF median score indicated an advanced level of implementation (605, IQR 450·4–705·0), but significantly lower scores were found in low-income (385, 279·7–442·9) and lower-middle-income countries (500·4, 345·0–657·5), and public facilities (515, 385–637·8). Core component 8 (built environment; 90·0, IQR 75·0–100·0) and core component 2 (guidelines; 87·5, 70·0–97·5) scored the highest, and core component 7 (workload, staffing, and bed occupancy; 70·0, 50–90) and core component 3 (education and training; 70 ·0, 50·0–85·0) scored the lowest. Overall, only 15·2% (Nw: 588 of 3873) of facilities met all IPCAF minimum requirements, ranging from 0% (0 of 417) in low-income countries to 25·6% (278 of 1087) in primary facilities, 9% (24 of 268) in secondary facilities, and 19% (18 of 95) in tertiary facilities in high-income countries. Interpretation: Despite an overall high IPCAF score globally, important gaps in IPC facility implementation and core components across income levels hinder IPC progress. Increased support for more effective and sustainable IPC programmes is crucial to reduce risks posed by outbreaks to global health security and to ensure patient and health worker safety.

Implementation of hand hygiene in health-care facilities: results from the WHO Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework global survey 2019,/articles/implementation-hand-hygiene-health-care-facilities-results-who-hand-hygiene-self-assessment,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 6 by assessing the level of hand hygiene implementation and its drivers in health-care facilities through a global WHO survey; 25% of health-care facilities in low-income and middle-income countries were found to lack basic hygiene services, including access to clean water.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Hand hygiene is at the core of effective infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes. 10 years after the development of the WHO Multimodal Hand Hygiene Improvement Strategy, we aimed to ascertain the level of hand hygiene implementation and its drivers in health-care facilities through a global WHO survey. Methods: From Jan 16 to Dec 31, 2019, IPC professionals were invited through email and campaigns to complete the online Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework (HHSAF). A geospatial clustering algorithm selected unique health-care facilities responses and post-stratification weighting was applied to improve representativeness. Weighted median HHSAF scores and IQR were reported. Drivers of the HHSAF score were determined through a generalised estimation equation. Findings: 3206 unique responses from 90 countries (46% WHO Member States) were included. The HHSAF score indicated an intermediate hand hygiene implementation level (350 points, IQR 248–430), which was positively associated with country income level and health-care facility funding structure. System Change had the highest score (85 points, IQR 55–100), whereby alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care has become standard practice in many health-care facilities, especially in high-income countries. Institutional Safety Climate had the lowest score (55 points, IQR 35–75). From 2015 to 2019, the median HHSAF score in health-care facilities participating in both HHSAF surveys (n=190) stagnated. Interpretation: Most health-care facilities had an intermediate level of hand hygiene implementation or higher, for which health-care facility funding and country income level were important drivers.

Severe mental illness in cancer is associated with disparities in psycho-oncological support,/articles/severe-mental-illness-cancer-associated-disparities-psycho-oncological-support,"Globally, about 18 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year1 and 450 million people (equally composed of both sexes) suffer from severe mental illnesses (SMI). A significant subgroup of patients with cancer and SMI are disadvantaged in terms of screening for distress and psycho-oncological care.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Patients with both cancer and a severe mental illness (SMI) have a higher risk of advanced stage cancer at diagnosis and poorer survival in comparison to individuals with cancer alone. The present study explores if similar disparities exist in terms of psycho-oncological support. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to group 10,945 patients with any type of cancer, of which 72 (0.7%) had been diagnosed with a SMI (ICD10-codes F20-F22, F24, F25, F28-F31, F32.3, F33.3), and 1056 (9.6%) with another mental disorder. Subgrouping was based on presence of SMI, other mental illnesses, stage of cancer at its first detection, screening for distress and receipt of information on psycho-oncology, consultation with a psychotherapist and/or psychiatrist, prescription of different psychotropic medication, and use of a patient care attendant. Five subgroups were identified. Patients with SMI were most likely to suffer from further mental comorbidities, to be prescribed antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers, and be in need of a patient care attendant. In comparison to patients without SMI, the larger one of 2 subgroups of patients with SMI had a low probability to be screened for distress and informed about psycho-oncological support services. A smaller subgroup of patients with SMI was probable to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer. In subgroups without patients with mental disorders, screening for distress and offering psycho-oncological support seemed to be economized unless benzodiazepines or opioids were prescribed. Contrary to published evidence, distress screening and offering psycho-oncological support is neglected in patients with SMI unless an advanced stage of cancer is being diagnosed.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This study estimates the costs of achieving full coverage of basic WASH and waste services in existing public health facilities in the 46 UN designated least-developed countries (LDCs). Methods: In this modelling study, in-need facilities were quantified by combining published counts of public facilities with estimated basic WASH and waste service coverage. Country-specific per-facility capital and recurrent costs to deliver basic services were collected via survey of country WASH experts and officials between Sept 24 and Dec 24, 2020. Baseline cost estimates were modelled and discounted by 5% per year. Key assumptions were adjusted to produce lower and upper estimates, including adjusting the discount rate to 8% and 3% per year, respectively. Findings: An estimated US$6·5 billion to $9·6 billion from 2021 to 2030 is needed to achieve full coverage of basic WASH and waste services in public health facilities in LDCs. Capital costs are $2·9 billion to $4·8 billion and recurrent costs are $3·6 billion to $4·8 billion over this time period. A mean of $0·24–0·40 per capita in capital investment is needed each year, and annual operations and maintenance costs are expected to increase from $0·10 in 2021 to $0·39–0·60 in 2030. Waste management accounts for the greatest share of costs, requiring $3·7 billion (46·6% of the total) in the baseline estimates, followed by $1·8 billion (23·1%) for sanitation, $1·5 billion (19·5%) for water, and $845 million (10·7%) for hygiene. Needs are greatest for non-hospital facilities ($7·4 billion [94%] of $7·9 billion) and for facilities in rural areas ($5·3 billion [68%]). Interpretation: Investment will need to increase to reach full coverage of basic WASH and waste services in public health facilities. Financial needs are modest compared with current overall health and WASH spending, and better service coverage will yield substantial health benefits. To sustain services and prevent degradation and early replacement, countries will need to routinely budget for operations and maintenance of WASH and waste management assets.

A unified heuristic approach to simultaneously detect fusarium and ergot damage in wheat,/articles/unified-heuristic-approach-simultaneously-detect-fusarium-and-ergot-damage-wheat,"Wheat is a major staple food in many diets worldwide. Authors identify a rapid and robust method for identifying fungi-infected damage to wheat crops, with the aim of reducing economic losses and hunger.
",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Fusarium spp. and Ergot (Claviceps purpurea) are fungal pathogenic species that infect cereals worldwide, causing widespread economic losses. Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDKs) in wheat often contain harmful mycotoxins, while Ergot damage (ERG) is commonly characterized by the presence of alkaloids. Both FDK and ERG damage could cause health hazards to people and animals. Currently, assessment of FDKs and ERG is performed by human visual inspection using distinctly different biochemical assays and/or wet chemistry methods, all of which are subjective, time-consuming and non-repeatable. In this study, the authors present a unified non-destructive optical method using visible-near-infrared (VNIR) (400-1000 nm) and short-wavelength near-infrared (SWIR) (1000-2500 nm) hyperspectral imaging (HI) to simultaneously detect FDK and ERG damage in wheat kernels. The un-mixing technique of spectral angle mapping (SAM) was employed for pixel- and object-wise classification of the three classes i.e. FDK, ERG and control (healthy), of non-touching wheat kernels. Overall classification accuracies of VNIR–93% and SWIR–85% were obtained with 100% classification of ERG samples in the VNIR range. To reduce model complexity, principle component analysis (PCA) was explored, and a subset of 12 significant wavelengths was selected. The SAM model based on these selected wavelengths did not achieve accurate prediction, indicating it requires the entire spectral data for reliable performance. However, a partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) model using the reduced wavelength subset achieved overall classification accuracies of VNIR–94% and SWIR–90%, which were better when compared to the SAM method. This study is the first known attempt to simultaneously identify two important fungal diseases in wheat using a completely non-invasive and non-destructive method.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: We conducted an exploratory study to assess the safety tolerability, and anti-fibrotic effects of PRI-724, a CBP/β-catenin inhibitor, in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced cirrhosis. Methods: This multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, non-placebo-controlled phase 1/2a trial was conducted at three hospitals in Japan. Between July 27, 2018, and July 13, 2021, we enrolled patients with HCV- and HBV-induced cirrhosis classified as Child–Pugh (CP) class A or B. In phase 1, 15 patients received intravenous infusions of PRI-724 at escalating doses of 140, 280, and 380 mg/m2/4 h twice weekly for 12 weeks. In phase 2a, 12 patients received the recommended PRI-724 dose. The primary endpoints of phases 1 and 2a were the frequency and severity of adverse events and efficacy in treating cirrhosis based on liver biopsy. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT 03620474). Findings: Three patients from phase 1 who received the recommended PRI-724 dose were evaluated to obtain efficacy and safety data in phase 2a. Serious adverse events occurred in three patients, one of which was possibly related to PRI-724. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea and nausea. PRI-724 did not decrease hepatic fibrosis with any statistical significance, either by ordinal scoring or measurement of collagen proportionate area at 12 weeks; however, we observed statistically significant improvements in liver stiffness, Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, and serum albumin level. Interpretation: Intravenous administration of 280 mg/m2/4 h PRI-724 over 12 weeks was preliminarily assessed to be well tolerated; however, further evaluation of anti-fibrotic effects in patients with cirrhosis is warranted.

Reports were recently published on hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) in patients who were treated with abatacept. However, the literature is limited to case reports and series, and no study has investigated the relationship between HBVr and abatacept using extensive population-based databases. Methods: Using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, we collected all cases of HBVr between Jan 1, 2006 and June 30, 2021, for abatacept and other drugs. Disproportionality was analysed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), which was considered significant when the lower limit of the 95% CI was >1. We also conducted a confirmatory analysis in the European pharmacovigilance database, EudraVigilance. Findings: During the study period, 77,669 adverse cases were reported for abatacept use. There were 2889 reports of HBVr with any drug during this period, of which 55 were reported with abatacept. The ROR for HBVr with abatacept was significantly elevated at 4·80 (95% CI 3·68–6·27). All 55 cases of HBVr with abatacept were reported as serious adverse events. Of them, six individuals were hospitalised and four died.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land,"Background: National food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) are generally designed from a human health perspective and often disregard sustainability aspects. Circular food production systems are a promising solution to achieve sustainable healthy diets. In such systems, closing nutrient cycles where possible and minimising external inputs contribute to reducing environmental impacts. This change could be made by limiting livestock feed to available low-opportunity-cost biomass (LOCB). We examined the compatibility of national dietary guidelines for animal products with livestock production on the basis of the feed supplied by available LOCB. Methods: We investigated whether the national dietary recommendations for animal products for Bulgaria, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland could be met with domestically available LOCB. We used an optimisation model that allocates feed resources to different species of farm animals. Of the resulting scenarios, we assessed the nutritional feasibility, climate impact, and land use. Findings: Our results showed the environmental benefits of reducing the recommended animal products in the FBDGs, and that animal products from LOCB could provide between 22% (Netherlands) and 47% (Switzerland) of total protein contributions of the FBDGs. This range covers a substantial part of the nutritional needs of the studied populations. To fully meet these needs, consumption of plant-based food could be increased. Interpretation: Our results contribute to the discussion of what quantities of animal products in dietary guidelines are compatible with circular food systems. Thus, national dietary recommendations for animal products should be revised and recommended quantities lowered. This finding is consistent with recent efforts to include sustainability criteria in dietary guidelines.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 1: No poverty,"Background: COVID-19 has directly affected millions of people. Others have been indirectly affected; for example, there has been a startling increase in hunger brought about by the pandemic. Many countries have sought to relieve this problem through public policy. This research examines the effectiveness of enhanced Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in the U.S. to alleviate hunger. Methods: Using a biweekly cross-sectional survey and corresponding population weights from the U.S. Census Bureau, we estimate the effects of enhanced SNAP benefits on hunger in the U.S. as measured by food insufficiency. We use a Bayesian structural time series analysis to predict counterfactual values of food insufficiency. We supplement these findings by examining the effect of enhanced SNAP benefits on observed visits to a food pantry network in a midsized U.S. city. Findings: Our primary finding estimates that nationwide a total 850,000 (95% credible interval 0·24–1·46 million) instances of food insufficiency were prevented per week by the 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits enacted in January 2021. Secondarily, we find similar effects associated with SNAP benefit increases and local food pantry visits. Specifically, enhanced SNAP benefits resulted in fewer visits to the food pantry network than were predicted in the counterfactual model. Interpretation: These results not only indicate that the policies enacted to mitigate hunger caused by the COVID-19 pandemic helped, but also quantifies how much these benefits helped on a national scale.

Negotiations of vulnerability in aging with vision impairment,/articles/negotiations-vulnerability-aging-vision-impairment,An investigation of the support needed for the visually impaired to be able to age successfully.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Longevity entails a higher prevalence of chronic impairments that often come with aging, such as age-related vision loss (ARLV). Dependence and increasing vulnerabilities contrast sharply with contemporary reductionist models of positive aging, and gradually worsening eyesight exposes older adults with ARLV to situations where idealized models of late life do not fit them. In analyzing semi-structured interviews conducted in Denmark with 40 older adults, aged 55–70 years, with vision loss, this study examines how people in late midlife and early late life negotiate their vulnerability, dependence, and need for help across different contexts. The findings illustrate how these lived experiences situate people with ARVL outside the idealized late life and how they negotiate their need for help in both their work life and private life. The findings also show how people with age-related vision loss perform a balancing act between the lived vulnerability and the prescribed role of vulnerability arising from social discourses. Some contexts allow people with ARVL to negotiate and re-negotiate their vulnerability, while others, such as work-life contexts, often offer less room for negotiating vulnerability and need for help. The study makes it clear that, given the cultural emphasis on extended work lives, the ways in which work cultures can adapt to age diversity and age-related disabilities must receive more attention.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Here, we combined psychological and electrophysiological methods (EEG) to investigate the sustained effects of an 8-week-long standardized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention on the brain activity of college students. We found that the Test group showed a decrease in negative emotional states after the intervention, compared to the no statistically significant result of the Control group, as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (33% reduction in the negative score) and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-42) scores (nearly 40% reduction of three subscale scores). Spectral analysis of EEG data showed that this intervention is longitudinally associated with increased frontal and occipital lobe alpha band power. Additionally, the increase in alpha power is more prevalent when the Test group was being stress-induced by cognitive tasks, suggesting that practicing MBSR might enhance the practitioners’ tolerance of negative emotional states. In conclusion, MBSR intervention led to a sustained reduction of negative emotional states as measured by both psychological and electrophysiological metrics, which supports the adoption of MBSR as an effective and sustainable stress-countering approach for students in LMICs.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Current Status and Problems of Breast Cancer Treatment with Schizophrenia,/articles/current-status-and-problems-breast-cancer-treatment-schizophrenia,"This study explores the current status and problems of breast cancer treatment with schizophrenia, including advanced stage diagnosis. It finds that patients with schizophrenia with reduced ADL are less likely to receive chemotherapy or recommended cancer treatment, and as such it is highly recommended that they breast cancer screening so that they can be diagnosed early and treated adequately.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disease that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the world that causes death in women. It is often unclear whether patients with schizophrenia receive recommended cancer treatment that met the guideline. This study characterized breast cancer treatment disruptions in schizophrenia patients and sought to identify and resolve correctable predictors of those disruptions. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 55 primary breast cancer patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated for breast cancer. We evaluated the characteristics of the breast cancer patients with schizophrenia compared to those of 610 breast cancer patients without schizophrenia. Results: Compared to the control group, the schizophrenia group had significantly advanced T and N factors and disease stage. Significantly fewer patients in the schizophrenia group than in the control group received chemotherapy (P < .0001) or recommended cancer treatment (P = .0004). Within the schizophrenia group, the patients in need of ADL support were significantly less likely to receive recommended cancer treatment. Conclusion: Patients with schizophrenia are often diagnosed with breast cancer in advanced stages. In addition, patients with schizophrenia with reduced ADL are less likely to receive chemotherapy or recommended cancer treatment. It is highly recommended that patients with schizophrenia undergo breast cancer screening so that they can be diagnosed early and treated adequately.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Links to good health and wellbeing for all.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 4: Quality education,"Objectives: Provide evidence on how young people's mental health has evolved in Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs) during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Identify particularly vulnerable groups who report high and/or continuously high rates of mental health issues. Study design: Longitudinal, observational. Methods: Two consecutive phone-surveys (August–October and November–December 2020) in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam interviewed around 9000 participants of a 20-year cohort study who grew up in poverty, now aged 19 and 26. Rates of at least mild anxiety/depression measured by GAD-7/PHQ-8 were each compared across countries; between males/females, and food secure/food insecure households. Results: Overall, rates of at least mild anxiety and mild depression significantly decreased between mid and end-2020 in all countries but Ethiopia as COVID-19 infection rates fell. Females report higher rates of anxiety and depression in all countries but Ethiopia, however the gender gap is closing. Young people in food insecure households have not shown consistent improvements in their rates of anxiety and depression. Food insecure households are poorer, and have significantly more children (p < 0.05) except in Ethiopia. Conclusion: Food insecurity is negatively associated with young people's mental health and urgent support targeted towards the most vulnerable should be a priority. Further research into increasing rates of mental health issues in Ethiopia is needed.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Perceived accessibility and mental health consequences of COVID-19 containment policies,/articles/perceived-accessibility-and-mental-health-consequences-covid-19-containment-policies,The article looks at the effects on mental health when accessibility was limited during COVID-19 containment policies.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Individuals have experienced various degrees of accessibility loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may consequently have influenced their mental health. Although efforts have been made to understand the mental health consequences of the pandemic and corresponding containment measures, the impacts of accessibility loss remain underexplored. Methods: Based on 186 family interviews, a 569-respondent panel survey was designed and distributed monthly from February to October 2020 in Kunming, China. A 3-wave cross-lagged panel model was developed to understand the causal relationship between mental health and perceived accessibility of daily necessities, key services, and social activities. Results: Goodness-of-fit indicators imply that the hypothesised model fits the observed data well: χ2/df = 2.221, AGFI = 0.910, NFI = 0.907, CFI = 0.933, RMSEA = 0.052. The results indicate that perceived accessibility of daily necessities and social activities had lagged effects on mental health status. The within-wave effects show that perceived accessibility of daily necessities (0.619, p < 0.01) and social activities (0.545, p < 0.01) significantly influenced respondents' mental health during the peak of the pandemic whilst perceived accessibility of social activities dominantly influenced their mental health after restrictions were lifted (0.779, p < 0.01). Perceived accessibility of public services such as healthcare did not significantly influence respondents’ mental health in any wave. COVID-19 containment policies had different mental outcomes across population groups. Disadvantaged people experienced mental health issues due to accessibility loss for daily necessities and social activities until the lifting of compulsory QR-code-for-buses, whilst better-off populations had better mental health during the early phase of the outbreak and rapidly recovered their mental health after mobility restrictions eased. Conclusion: Reduced perceived accessibility of daily necessities and social activities may be an underlying cause of mental health problems. Relative accessibility deprivation exacerbated mental health inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, few studies have made comparisons of healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs. The current study aimed to compare mental health problems among HCWs with non-HCWs during the initial lockdown of COVID 19. Study design: A population-based cross-sectional survey. Methods: The survey was conducted by means of an open web link between April and May 2020. Data were collected by self-report. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to assess posttraumatic stress. Results: A total of 4527 citizens answered the questionnaire and 32.1% were HCWs. The majority were female, under 60 years of age, and lived in urban areas. Among the HCWs, the majority were registered nurses working in hospitals. The prevalence were 12.8% vs 19.1% for anxiety, 8.5% vs 14.5% for depression and 13.6% vs 20.9% for PTSD among HCWs and non-HCWs respectively. The highest prevalence's for anxiety and PTSD among HCWs were found for those under 40 years of age and having low education level (<12 years). Conclusion: Mental health problems was significantly lower among HCWs compared to non-HCWs. However, the COVID-19 poses a challenge for HCWs, especially young HCWs and those with low level of education.

The evidence is clear and convincing that racial/ethnic discrimination is harmful for adolescents’ socioemotional and behavioral well-being as well as their academic success. Discrimination measurement, however, poses a critical source of potential variation in the observed effect sizes capturing the associations between racial/ethnic discrimination and adolescents’ well-being. This meta-analysis integrated 1,804 effect sizes on 156,030 unique ethnically- and geographically-diverse adolescents (Mage = 14.44, SD = 2.27) from 379 studies that used 79 unique instruments to assess racial/ethnic discrimination. The meta-analysis focused on a host of measurement-related moderators, including the number of items, response scale and response dimensions, reliability, retrospective reference period, perpetrators, and initial target populations. Larger effect sizes were observed for instruments with more items and with non-dichotomously rated items. Perpetrator and retrospective reference period also emerged as key moderators, while measure reliability, response dimensions, and initial measurement development characteristics were not significant moderators.

The primary aim of this study is to determine the current influence of religion/culture among MENA women and their preferences for physicians of same sex, culture, and religion on the avoidance and uncomfortableness of routine and women's health exams. Methods: A cross sectional community survey including religiosity and the importance of physician matched sex, culture, and religion was completed. Outcome measures were avoidance of a routine physical exam, or a women's health exam because of religious/cultural issues; and the uncomfortableness of the women's health exam. Linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between outcomes and potential predictors, with significance assessed using a bootstrap method. Findings: The responses of 97 MENA women 30–65 years old showed that MENA women agreed that they would avoid routine health exams because of religious/cultural issues if their physician was of the same religion or culture as they were (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively) or they had less education (p < 0.05). MENA women also avoided women's health exams due to religious/cultural issues if her physician was of the same religion as she (p < 0.01). Interpretation: MENA women 30–65 years old may no longer be bound to a female physician of their same religion/culture for their health exams.

This study aimed to estimate the association between common urogenital infections and cervical neoplasia. Methods: A multi-register national cohort study of 4,120,557 women aged ≥15 years (2002–2018) was conducted. The outcomes were cervical cancer and carcinoma in situ (Swedish Cancer Register). The main predictors were urogenital infections—(urinary) cystitis, (bacterial) vaginosis, (candida) vulvovaginitis. Incidence rates per 10,000 person-years were calculated (using the European Standard Population). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) while adjusting for possible confounders—other genital infections (e.g., cervicitis, salpingitis, urogenital herpes), parity, and sociodemographic factors. Findings: In 39·0 million person-years of follow-up, the incidence rate for cervical cancer was 1·2 (95% CI 1·1–1·2) per 10,000 person-years and the figure for cervical carcinoma in situ was more than tenfold higher. The fully adjusted HRs for cervical cancer were 1·31 (95% CI 1·15 and 1·48) and 1·22 (95% CI 1·16 and 1·29) for vaginosis and cystitis, respectively. Vaginosis showed a gradient association to carcinoma in situ. Vulvovaginitis was inversely associated with cervical cancer, but not significantly related with carcinoma in situ in the fully adjusted model. A temporal association with cervical cancer was observed for vaginosis and vulvovaginitis (inversely) but not for cystitis. Interpretation: In this large nationwide cohort of women, medically attended common urogenital infections were independently associated with cervical neoplasia, but cystitis was not temporally associated with cervical neoplasia. These findings could be used to increase focus on preventive measures, HPV-vaccination programmes, HPV-analyses- and cervical cancer screening, especially in women suffering from vaginosis. Future studies on the causal mechanism are warranted before generalized public health recommendations can be made.

However, most existing studies have focused on its direct impact on health. Here, we aimed to explore the indirect effects of COVID-19 on gender disparities globally. Methods: We reviewed publicly available datasets with information on indicators related to vaccine hesitancy and uptake, health care services, economic and work-related concerns, education, and safety at home and in the community. We used mixed effects regression, Gaussian process regression, and bootstrapping to synthesise all data sources. We accounted for uncertainty in the underlying data and modelling process. We then used mixed effects logistic regression to explore gender gaps globally and by region. Findings: Between March, 2020, and September, 2021, women were more likely to report employment loss (26·0% [95% uncertainty interval 23·8–28·8, by September, 2021) than men (20·4% [18·2–22·9], by September, 2021), as well as forgoing work to care for others (ratio of women to men: 1·8 by March, 2020, and 2·4 by September, 2021). Women and girls were 1·21 times (1·20–1·21) more likely than men and boys to report dropping out of school for reasons other than school closures. Women were also 1·23 (1·22–1·23) times more likely than men to report that gender-based violence had increased during the pandemic. By September 2021, women and men did not differ significantly in vaccine hesitancy or uptake. Interpretation: The most significant gender gaps identified in our study show intensified levels of pre-existing widespread inequalities between women and men during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Substantial progress has been made in dissecting the 2 main autoimmune mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of CSU. Type I autoimmune (autoallergic) CSU is associated with IgE antibodies against autoantigens, for example, thyroid peroxidase and IL-24. Type IIb autoimmune CSU is mediated by autoantibodies that activate mast cells, for example, via IgE and FcεRI, and is present in less than 10% of patients with CSU when strict criteria are used, that is, triple positivity of autologous serum skin test, immunoassays for IgG autoantibodies, and basophil activation tests. A subpopulation of patients with CSU has both types. Type IIb autoimmune CSU is characterized by higher disease severity, concomitant autoimmune diseases, low levels of total IgE, elevated levels of IgG-anti–thyroid peroxidase, basopenia, eosinopenia, poor response to antihistamines and to omalizumab, and a good response to cyclosporine. Novel targeted therapies for CSU are under development such as ligelizumab, an anti-IgE, fenebrutinib and remibrutinib, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and dupilumab, an anti–IL-4Rα.

The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network Adult (known as IPEN) study (N=11 615; 14 cities across ten countries) provided data on local urban design and transport features linked to walking. Associations of these features with the probability of engaging in any walking for transport and sufficient physical activity (≥150 min/week) by walking were estimated, and thresholds associated with the physical activity criteria were determined. Curvilinear associations of population, street intersection, and public transport densities with walking were found. Neighbourhoods exceeding around 5700 people per km2, 100 intersections per km2, and 25 public transport stops per km2 were associated with meeting one or both physical activity criteria.

Since there are limited ground monitoring stations in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA), calculating the degree of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and PM2.5 is thus a challenge. The research aimed to retrieve the AOD at 30 m spatial resolution using the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) based on Landsat imageries. Landsat 4–5 and 8 cloud-free images at 30 m spatial resolution were obtained from 1999 to 2019 at 5 years interval to retrieve AOD and estimate Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentrations.

Assisted eating in late-stage dementia: Intercorporeal interaction,/articles/assisted-eating-late-stage-dementia-intercorporeal-interaction,"This article addresses supporting those with late-stage dementia to maintain quality of life.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"In this article, we argue that investigating and learning about agentive abilities of people living with late-stage dementia requires a theoretical framework that focuses on the use of bodily resources in interpersonal interaction (i.e., intercorporeality) for performing joint activities rather than on solely the use of spoken language. Assisted eating, which involves people living with late-stage dementia and professional carers, is taken as an empirical example. The study is based on observations and video recordings of occasions of assisted eating involving five people with late-stage dementia in a residential elder care home; one of these people is used as an example in this paper. The analysis shows that assisted eating is performed as a joint intercorporeal activity. The participants create joint attentional space and a common space of action for their bodily movements when they give and receive food. The participants engaged in the activity coordinate their bodily moves with each other. The analysis (1) demonstrates that the collaboration between people living with late-stage dementia and nurses is based on practical interdependent and co-operative bodily actions. (2) This makes it possible to better understand agency in terms of intercorporeal interaction displayed by people living with late-stage dementia. (3) The agency demonstrated in intercorporeal interaction is thus considered to be shared and distributed across bodies and requires support to be interactionally achieved. (4) The intercorporeal interaction as grounds for agency not only calls on other participants to note and honor the agency of the person with dementia that is still evident in embodied interaction, but also invites others to support people with dementia to claim and display their agency in social interactions and joint activities.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Individual cardiometabolic disorders and genetic factors are associated with an increased dementia risk; however, the relationship between dementia and cardiometabolic multimorbidity is unclear. We investigated whether cardiometabolic multimorbidity increases the risk of dementia, regardless of genetic risk, and examined for associated brain structural changes. Methods: We examined health and genetic data from 203 038 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, aged 60 years or older without dementia at baseline assessment (2006–10) and followed up until March 31, 2021, in England and Scotland and Feb 28, 2018, in Wales, as well as brain structural data in a nested imaging subsample of 12 236 participants. A cardiometabolic multimorbidity index comprising stroke, diabetes, and myocardial infarction (one point for each), and a polygenic risk score for dementia (with low, intermediate, and high risk groups) were calculated for each participant. The main outcome measures were incident all-cause dementia and brain structural metrics. Findings: The dementia risk associated with high cardiometabolic multimorbidity was three times greater than that associated with high genetic risk (hazard ratio [HR] 5·55, 95% CI 3·39–9·08, p<0·0001, and 1·68, 1·53–1·84, p<0·0001, respectively). Participants with both a high genetic risk and a cardiometabolic multimorbidity index of two or greater had an increased risk of developing dementia (HR 5·74, 95% CI 4·26–7·74, p<0·0001), compared with those with a low genetic risk and no cardiometabolic conditions. Crucially, we found no interaction between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and polygenic risk (p=0·18). Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was independently associated with more extensive, widespread brain structural changes including lower hippocampal volume (F2, 12 110 = 10·70; p<0·0001) and total grey matter volume (F2, 12 236 = 55·65; p<0·0001). Interpretation: Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was independently associated with the risk of dementia and extensive brain imaging differences to a greater extent than was genetic risk. Targeting cardiometabolic multimorbidity might help to reduce the risk of dementia, regardless of genetic risk.

However, little is known about the collaborative work between different people living with dementia. Accordingly, this study aims to explore how people living with dementia, without the support of a cognitively healthy interlocutor, collaborate with other people living with dementia in an unfamiliar activity. The study is based on video recordings of three dyads, each comprising two individuals living with dementia, as they are using tablet computers with reminiscence and communication aiding applications. Drawing on multimodal interaction analysis, we show how the participants living with dementia treat the activities as joint endeavors and, when needed, engage in problem-solving sequences where they make their knowledge about how to progress within the activities publicly visible to their interlocutor.

We aimed to determine the overall efficiency of tuberculosis spending and investigate associated factors in 121 low-income and middle-income countries between 2010 and 2019. Methods: In this data envelopment and stochastic frontier analysis, we used data from the WHO Global TB report series on tuberculosis spending as the input and treatment coverage as the output to estimate tuberculosis spending efficiency. We investigated associations between 25 independent variables and overall efficiency. Findings: We estimated global tuberculosis spending efficiency to be between 73·8% (95% CI 71·2–76·3) and 87·7% (84·9–90·6) in 2019, depending on the analytical method used. This estimate suggests that existing global tuberculosis treatment coverage could be increased by between 12·3% (95% CI 9·4–15·1) and 26·2% (23·7–28·8) for the same amount of spending. Efficiency has improved over the study period, mainly since 2015, but a substantial difference of 70·7–72·1 percentage points between the most and least efficient countries still exists. We found a consistent significant association between efficiency and current health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product, out-of-pocket spending on health, and some Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators such as universal health coverage. Interpretation: To improve efficiency, treatment coverage will need to be increased, particularly in the least efficient contexts where this might require additional spending. However, progress towards global End TB targets is slow even in the most efficient countries. Variables associated with TB spending efficiency suggest efficiency is complimented by commitments to improving health-care access that is free at the point of use and wider progress towards the SDGs. These findings support calls for additional investment in tuberculosis care. Funding: None.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine may be contributing to disparities in vaccine delivery to ethnic minority communities. This systematic review aims to strengthen understanding of COVID-19 vaccine concerns among ethnic minorities in the UK. Five databases were searched in February 2022, yielding 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting on vaccine hesitancy or acceptance in ethnic minority groups. Data were extracted using a standardised form, and quality assessment was carried out using the Standard Quality Criteria. There were three key themes: (1). Prevalence of vaccine hesitancy; (2). Reasons for vaccine hesitancy and acceptance; and (3). Recommendations to address vaccine concerns. Vaccine hesitancy, which was more common among some ethnic minority groups, is a complex phenomenon, driven by misinformation, mistrust, concerns about safety and efficacy, and structural and systemic inequities. Community engagement and tailored communication may help to address vaccine concerns. Robust data disaggregated by ethnicities are needed to better understand barriers and facilitators for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in ethnic minority communities. Strategies to address structural disadvantage need to be inclusive, comprehensive, and behaviorally informed and foster confidence in healthcare systems and governments.

",Goal 4: Quality education; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"Background: Global sustainability is an enmeshed system of complex socioeconomic, climatological, and ecological interactions. The numerous objectives of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement have various levels of interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain the influence of changes to particular indicators across the whole system. In this analysis, we aimed to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of sustainability agendas. Methods: We developed a method to find interlinkages among the 17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and non-monotonic dependences. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an 18th variable (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This method detects significant dependencies among the time evolution of the objectives by using partial distance correlations, a non-linear measure of conditional dependence that also discounts spurious correlations originating from lurking variables. We then used a network representation to identify the most important objectives (using network centrality) and to obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as highly interconnected clusters in the network). Findings: Using temporal data from 181 countries spanning 20 years, we analysed dependencies among SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based on region, development, and income level. The observed significant interlinkages, central objectives, and nexuses identified varied greatly across country groupings; however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) and climate change ranked as highly important across many country groupings. Temperature rise was strongly linked to urbanisation, air pollution, and slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country groupings likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown, such as Africa. In several country groupings composed of developing nations, we observed a consistent nexus of strongly interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty reduction), SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic growth), sometimes incorporating SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice). Interpretation: The differences across groupings emphasise the need to define goals in accordance with local circumstances and priorities. Our analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG 17) as a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG 8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal of development, our analysis showed that education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more central, thus suggesting that these could be prioritised in global partnerships. Urban livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the past.

This genomic resource covers a wide range of poorly characterized eukaryotic lineages that complement long-standing contributions from culture collections while better representing plankton in the upper layer of the oceans. We performed the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive genome-wide functional classification of abundant unicellular eukaryotic plankton, revealing four major groups connecting distantly related lineages.

",Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) constitute an emerging energy transition paradigm, with an ambitious timeline for rapid upscaling to match the urgency of climate mitigation and adaptation. Increasingly networked and coordinated actors aim to realise 100 PEDs across Europe by 2025. This resonates with the mission orientation turn of the European Green New Deal, to inspire and enable target-driven innovation. Yet it raises questions that have long perplexed scholars and practitioners in energy transitions: how can rapid diffusion be achieved in a sustained and replicable manner in diverse socio-technical contexts? Identifying the key questions to address and implement fit-to-purpose solutions within short-term project timescales is essential in order to mainstream PEDs. Such solutionism must be accompanied by a healthy dose of scepticism, in order to avoid undesirable outcomes such as exacerbated inequalities, societal backlash, and spatial displacement of invisible burdens. But it also requires proactive sharing of experiences, responsive learning and dissemination, and cooperation across sectors and disciplines. In this timely contribution, thirteen researchers from nine European countries flag ten questions concerning PEDs, and offer preliminary responses in line with cutting-edge insights informed by science and practice. This contribution draws on multidisciplinary competence in steering the Positive Energy Districts European Network, and aims to make emerging knowledge widely available, while also inviting constructive critique and engagement within the PED arena which features a broad range of diverse stakeholders.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 5: Gender equality; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis has been introduced in more than 70 countries, including many in sub-Saharan Africa, but women experience considerable barriers to daily pill-taking, such as stigma, judgement, and the fear of violence. Safe and effective long-acting agents for HIV prevention are needed for women. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of injectable cabotegravir compared with daily oral tenofovir diphosphate plus emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) for HIV prevention in HIV-uninfected women. Methods: HPTN 084 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, superiority trial in 20 clinical research sites in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were eligible for enrolment if they were assigned female sex at birth, were aged 18–45 years, reported at least two episodes of vaginal intercourse in the previous 30 days, were at risk of HIV infection based on an HIV risk score, and agreed to use a long-acting reversible contraceptive method. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either active cabotegravir with TDF-FTC placebo (cabotegravir group) or active TDF-FTC with cabotegravir placebo (TDF-FTC group). Study staff and participants were masked to study group allocation, with the exception of the site pharmacist who was responsible for study product preparation. Participants were prescribed 5 weeks of daily oral product followed by intramuscular injections every 8 weeks after an initial 4-week interval load, alongside daily oral pills. Participants who discontinued injections were offered open-label daily TDF-FTC for 48 weeks. The primary endpoints of the study were incident HIV infection in the intention-to-treat population, and clinical and laboratory events that were grade 2 or higher in all women who had received at least one dose of study product. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03164564. Findings: From Nov 27, 2017, to Nov 4, 2020, we enrolled 3224 participants (1614 in the cabotegravir group and 1610 in the TDF-FTC group). Median age was 25 years (IQR 22–30); 1755 (54·7%) of 3209 had two or more partners in the preceding month. 40 incident infections were observed over 3898 person-years (HIV incidence 1·0% [95% CI 0·73–1·40]); four in the cabotegravir group (HIV incidence 0·2 cases per 100 person-years [0·06–0·52]) and 36 in the TDF-FTC group (1·85 cases per 100 person-years [1·3–2·57]; hazard ratio 0·12 [0·05–0·31]; p<0·0001; risk difference –1·6% [–1·0% to –2·3%]. In a random subset of 405 TDF-FTC participants, 812 (42·1%) of 1929 plasma samples had tenofovir concentrations consistent with daily use. Injection coverage was 93% of the total number of person-years. Adverse event rates were similar across both groups, apart from injection site reactions, which were more frequent in the cabotegravir group than in the TDF-FTC group (577 [38·0%] of 1519 vs 162 [10·7%] of 1516]) but did not result in injection discontinuation. Confirmed pregnancy incidence was 1·3 per 100 person-years (0·9–1·7); no congenital birth anomalies were reported. Interpretation: Although both products for HIV prevention were generally safe, well tolerated, and effective, cabotegravir was superior to TDF-FTC in preventing HIV infection in women.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Approaches that allow easy access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), such as over-the-counter provision at pharmacies, could facilitate risk-informed PrEP use and lead to lower HIV incidence, but their cost-effectiveness is unknown. We aimed to evaluate conditions under which risk-informed PrEP use is cost-effective. Methods: We applied a mathematical model of HIV transmission to simulate 3000 setting-scenarios reflecting a range of epidemiological characteristics of communities in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of HIV viral load greater than 1000 copies per mL among all adults (HIV positive and negative) varied from 1·1% to 7·4% (90% range). We hypothesised that if PrEP was made easily available without restriction and with education regarding its use, women and men would use PrEP, with sufficient daily adherence, during so-called seasons of risk (ie, periods in which individuals are at risk of acquiring infection). We refer to this as risk-informed PrEP. For each setting-scenario, we considered the situation in mid-2021 and performed a pairwise comparison of the outcomes of two policies: immediate PrEP scale-up and then continuation for 50 years, and no PrEP. We estimated the relationship between epidemic and programme characteristics and cost-effectiveness of PrEP availability to all during seasons of risk. For our base-case analysis, we assumed a 3-monthly PrEP cost of US$29 (drug $11, HIV test $4, and $14 for additional costs necessary to facilitate education and access), a cost-effectiveness threshold of $500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, an annual discount rate of 3%, and a time horizon of 50 years. In sensitivity analyses, we considered a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 per DALY averted, a discount rate of 7% per annum, the use of PrEP outside of seasons of risk, and reduced uptake of risk-informed PrEP. Findings: In the context of PrEP scale-up such that 66% (90% range across setting-scenarios 46–81) of HIV-negative people with at least one non-primary condomless sex partner take PrEP in any given period, resulting in 2·6% (0·9–6·0) of all HIV negative adults taking PrEP at any given time, risk-informed PrEP was predicted to reduce HIV incidence by 49% (23–78) over 50 years compared with no PrEP. PrEP was cost-effective in 71% of all setting-scenarios, and cost-effective in 76% of setting-scenarios with prevalence of HIV viral load greater than 1000 copies per mL among all adults higher than 2%. In sensitivity analyses with a $100 per DALY averted cost-effectiveness threshold, a 7% per year discount rate, or with PrEP use that was less well risk-informed than in our base case, PrEP was less likely to be cost-effective, but generally remained cost-effective if the prevalence of HIV viral load greater than 1000 copies per mL among all adults was higher than 3%. In sensitivity analyses based on additional setting-scenarios in which risk-informed PrEP was less extensively used, the HIV incidence reduction was smaller, but the cost-effectiveness of risk-informed PrEP was undiminished. Interpretation: Under the assumption that making PrEP easily accessible for all adults in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of community education leads to risk-informed use, PrEP is likely to be cost-effective in settings with prevalence of HIV viral load greater than 1000 copies per mL among all adults higher than 2%, suggesting the need for implementation of such approaches, with ongoing evaluation.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Mercury mining is one of the main sources of mercury (Hg) release into the environment, causing serious impacts on human health and the environment. Workers in these mines are employed informally and precariously and therefore lack labor rights such as social security. The objective of the study is to make visible the exposure to environmental contaminants and the health of workers in mercury mines. An environmental assessment was conducted to determine workers' exposure to contaminants; urine samples were obtained to measure exposure to mercury and arsenic, and blood samples were obtained for lead and cadmium. Clinical parameters were also evaluated. Concentrations of Hg, As and Pb were determined in soil, 279.4 mg/kg (24.4−788.5), 14.7 mg/kg (9.5−20.3) and 1.4 mg/kg (1−2.8), respectively. The exposure results for mercury were 551 μg/g creatinine, for arsenic 50 μg/L and for lead 4.7 μg/dL. Cd-B was not found. In addition, 17.6 % of the workers had diabetes and 17.6 % had renal disorders. Principal Component Regression was performed obtaining an r2 of 0.86 for glomerular filtration rate and 0.54 for albumin creatinine ratio using clinical, occupational, and metal exposure variables.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Strategies to improve outcomes for Australian First Nations mothers and babies are urgently needed. Caseload midwifery, where women have midwife-led continuity throughout pregnancy, labour, birth and the early postnatal period, is associated with substantially better perinatal health outcomes, but few First Nations women receive it. We assessed the capacity of four maternity services in Victoria, Australia, to implement, embed, and sustain a culturally responsive caseload midwifery service. Methods: A prospective, non-randomised research translational study design was used. Site specific culturally responsive caseload models were developed by site working groups in partnership with their First Nations health units and the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation. The primary outcome was to increase the proportion of women having a First Nations baby proactively offered and receiving caseload midwifery as measured before and after programme implementation. The study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection commenced at the Royal Women's Hospital on 06/03/2017, Joan Kirner Women's and Children's Hospital 01/10/2017 and Mercy Hospital for Women 16/04/2018, with data collection completed at all sites on 31/12/2020. Findings: The model was successfully implemented in three major metropolitan maternity services between 2017 and 2020. Prior to this, over a similar timeframe, only 5.8% of First Nations women (n = 34) had ever received caseload midwifery at the three sites combined. Of 844 women offered the model, 90% (n = 758) accepted it, of whom 89% (n = 663) received it. Another 40 women received standard caseload. Factors including ongoing staffing crises, prevented the fourth site, in regional Victoria, implementing the model. Interpretation: Key enablers included co-design of the study and programme implementation with First Nations people, staff cultural competency training, identification of First Nations women (and babies), and regular engagement between caseload midwives and First Nations hospital and community teams. Further work should include a focus on addressing cultural and workforce barriers to implementation of culturally responsive caseload midwifery in regional areas.

Social-capital-based mental health interventions for refugees: A systematic review,/articles/social-capital-based-mental-health-interventions-refugees-systematic-review,This article ties to SDG 3. It analyzes how social-capital-based interventions can improve the mental health of refugees.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"With over 80 million people forcibly displaced worldwide, providing safe, healthy, and supportive places for refugees has become an imperative for national governments, aid organizations, and host communities. While much has been written about the needs of these displaced people, organizations and practitioners tend to focus on essential material needs, medical care, and food and water provisioning. Yet a growing body of evidence points to the potential role of social capital – the bonding, bridging, and linking social ties that connect us to one another – as a critical resource for these refugees. We have little data about social capital interventions at individual and community levels to assist with mental health for this vulnerable population, and even less methodical evidence about such interventions’ impact. This systematic review analyzes nearly 400 articles to find patterns in the literature on how social-capital-based interventions can improve the mental health of refugees. Within the studies of interventions that met our filtering criteria, the reinforcement or creation of social capital, especially bridging and linking types, serves as a crucial resource to help this vulnerable group. Specifically, our review showed that community and multilevel social capital interventions are key to curbing mental health symptoms among refugees. Given this scanty evidence base among a group so vulnerable to mental health problems, this review serves as an explicit invitation for researchers to further examine social capital interventions among refugees.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Anaemia causes health and economic harms. The prevalence of anaemia in women aged 15–49 years, by pregnancy status, is indicator 2.2.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the aim of halving the anaemia prevalence in women of reproductive age by 2030 is an extension of the 2025 global nutrition targets endorsed by the World Health Assembly (WHA). We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anaemia by severity for children aged 6–59 months, non-pregnant women aged 15–49 years, and pregnant women aged 15–49 years in 197 countries and territories and globally for the period 2000–19. Methods: For this pooled analysis of population-representative data, we collated 489 data sources on haemoglobin distribution in children and women from 133 countries, including 4·5 million haemoglobin measurements. Our data sources comprised health examination, nutrition, and household surveys, accessed as anonymised individual records or as summary statistics such as mean haemoglobin and anaemia prevalence. We used a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model to estimate haemoglobin distributions in each population and country-year. This model allowed for coherent estimation of mean haemoglobin and prevalence of anaemia by severity. Findings: Globally, in 2019, 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 36–44) of children aged 6–59 months were anaemic, compared to 48% (45–51) in 2000. Globally, the prevalence of anaemia in non-pregnant women aged 15–49 years changed little between 2000 and 2019, from 31% (95% UI 28–34) to 30% (27–33), while in pregnant women aged 15–49 years it decreased from 41% (39–43) to 36% (34–39). In 2019, the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6–59 months exceeded 70% in 11 countries and exceeded 50% in all women aged 15–49 years in ten countries. Globally in all populations and in most countries and regions, the prevalence of mild anaemia changed little, while moderate and severe anaemia declined in most populations and geographical locations, indicating a shift towards mild anaemia. Interpretation: Globally, regionally, and in nearly all countries, progress on anaemia in women aged 15–49 years is insufficient to meet the WHA global nutrition target to halve anaemia prevalence by 2030, and the prevalence of anaemia in children also remains high. A better understanding of the context-specific causes of anaemia and quality implementation of effective multisectoral actions to address these causes are needed.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 15: Life on land,"Background: Child malnutrition remains widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural areas where many households are involved in subsistence farming. Increasing farm-level production diversity (FPD) is often considered a useful strategy to improve child diets and nutrition, but the empirical evidence is mixed. Most studies have investigated associations between FPD and dietary diversity. We therefore aimed to analyse associations between FPD and child and adolescent nutritional status. Methods: In this multicountry, longitudinal study, we used representative panel data from four countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) to test the hypothesis that higher FPD is positively associated with child and adolescent nutritional status. The data were from the Living Standards Measurement Study–Integrated Surveys on Agriculture collected between 2008 and 2019. We included data from all children and adolescents aged 0–18 years with available anthropometric data who were living in households involved in farming activities for home consumption, market sales, or both. FPD was measured in terms of the number of different crop and livestock species and food groups produced on each farm. Child and adolescent nutritional status was measured in terms of height-for-age Z scores (HAZ). We estimated panel data regression models with correlated random effects to control for confounding factors and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Findings: The total sample size included 50 689 child and adolescent observations. In combined models, with data from all countries included, we found one additional species produced on the farm (crop and livestock combined) was associated with a mean 0·015 SD greater child or adolescent HAZ (p<0·0001). The role of FPD tended to decrease with better market access (in more remote locations mean 0·020 SD [p<0·0001] and in less remote locations mean 0·008 SD [p=0·091]). In individual-country models, the effects were smaller and statistically insignificant in three of the four countries. Livestock diversity had larger positive associations with HAZ than crop diversity (livestock diversity effect on HAZ mean 0·085 SD [p<0·0001] and crop diversity effect on HAZ mean 0·007 SD [p=0·080]). In Tanzania and Uganda, higher crop diversity was negatively associated with child and adolescent HAZ. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that further farm-level diversification is not a suitable general strategy to improve child and adolescent nutrition but might be useful in some situations. Livestock production seems to be conducive for improving child and adolescent nutrition on average. Context-specific approaches need to be developed.

Additionally, mitochondria are interconnected with the plaques formed by amyloid-β in AD and have underlying roles in the progression of the disease and severity. For years, the biomedical field struggled to develop new therapeutic options for AD without a significant advancement. However, mitochondria are striking back existing outside cells in a new mechanism of intercellular communication.

This study looks at how the UN HCR program to resettle refugees is helping.,"Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions","Background: Programme Refugees are refugees who are invited into a country by its government in response to a request for protection from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The increase in arrivals of Programme Refugees to Ireland has received a lot of attention to date. With financial support from the European Union, Ireland intends to grant entry to a further 2900 Programme Refugees via this unique pathway known as the Irish Refugee and Protection Programme (IRPP) between 2020 and 2023. This novel research explores the experiences of Programme Refugees resettling in Ireland within a psychological framework. Method: This research adopted an exploratory approach using a qualitative framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine Programme Refugees living in the community (5 male, 4 female) with an average age of 37 years. The average length of time in Ireland was 33 months, of which an average of 25 months was spent resettled in permanent housing. Results: Codebook thematic analysis underpinned by a critical realist epistemology was used to analyse the data. Two key themes were identified; “The home change our life” and “I can start my new life”. Conclusion: This research obtains the refugee's perspective and personal insights of availing of the IRPP and resettling in Ireland. Although the purposive sampling reduces the generalisability of findings to Programme Refugees resettled in the West of Ireland, this research offers an awareness and understanding of a Programme Refugee's journey towards resettlement and the impact it can have on their mental health and psychological well-being. This research has implications for national and European resettlement policies, and it is hoped that it can be used to guide the development of future resettlement programmes internationally.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

However, information regarding the effect of alcohol and caffeine consumption on iron metabolism is limited.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production,"Background & Aims: There is clear evidence that lifestyle factors affect iron bioavailability. However, information regarding the effect of alcohol and caffeine consumption on iron metabolism is limited. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of caffeine and alcohol consumption on iron metabolism in healthy men, regarding their everyday physical activity level. Methods: The study enrolled 83 men (59 physically active and 24 sedentary men) aged 18–32 years. Fasting blood samples were collected. ELISA kits were used to determine levels of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, hemojuvelin, and C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Level of physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Caffeine and alcohol intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. A general linear model was performed to evaluate the relationship between caffeine intake and levels of serum ferritin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, hemojuvelin, and hsCRP. Results: Physically active men (but not sedentary men) who consumed alcohol in excess presented higher ferritin levels when compared to moderate drinkers and abstainers (R2 = 0.35, p = 0.0001). Heavy drinkers presented the highest hepcidin levels when compared to both abstainers and moderate drinkers (p < 0.0001 for physically active, and p = 0.0267 for sedentary men). However, moderate drinkers showed significantly lower hsCRP levels when compared to heavy drinkers and abstainers drinkers (p < 0.0001 for physically active, and p = 0.0116 for sedentary men). Greater caffeine intake was generally associated with greater serum hepcidin levels, with the strongest effect on moderate drinkers. A significant influence of caffeine intake on hsCRP was shown for physically active men but not for sedentary men - greater caffeine intake was connected with higher hsCRP levels for participants who drank alcohol. Conclusion: Based on the presented results it can be assumed that high caffeine consumption may lead to suppression of iron bioavailability through increased inflammation. Furthermore, physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption seemed to benefit reduction of inflammatory response, at least as represented by hsCRP levels.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Searching for new therapeutic options for the uncommon pathogen Mycobacterium chimaera: an open drug discovery approach,/articles/searching-new-therapeutic-options-uncommon-pathogen-mycobacterium-chimaera-open-drug,"This Article supports SDG 3, focusing on using an open drug discovery platform to identify compounds that inhibit Mycobacterium chimaera, as well as investigating possible drug repurposing options",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Mycobacterium chimaera is a slowly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium associated with outbreaks of fatal infections in patients after cardiac surgery, and it is increasingly being detected in patients with chronic lung conditions. M chimaera can cause disseminated disease, osteomyelitis, and chronic skin or soft-tissue infections. We aimed to find new inhibitory compounds and drug repurposing opportunities for M chimaera, as current therapeutic options often result in poor outcomes. Methods: In an open drug discovery approach, we screened the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) Pathogen Box to assess the in-vitro antimicrobial drug susceptibility of M chimaera compared with the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of the slowly growing, major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the rapidly growing Mycobacterium abscessus reference strains. Compounds identified from an initial resazurin microtitre cell viability assay screen were further characterised by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MMV Pathogen Box compounds against M chimaera; and the MICs of a panel of 20 drugs commonly used to treat mycobacterial infections against M tuberculosis, M abscessus, and M chimaera. We also assessed the time-kill kinetics of doxycycline, clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin against M chimaera. Findings: M chimaera was inhibited by 21 (5%) of 400 compounds in the Pathogen Box. Ten compounds were active against all three mycobacteria. MMV675968, with activity against slowly growing mycobacteria that probably targets folate metabolism, had a mean MIC of 2·22 μM (0·80 μg/mL) against M chimaera. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that oxazolidinones such as linezolid (mean MIC 3·13 μg/mL) were active against M chimaera and that bedaquiline was the most potent compound (mean MIC 0·02 μg/mL). Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug with excellent tissue penetration properties, also inhibited M chimaera with a mean MIC of 6·25 μg/mL. Interpretation: Molecular diagnostics present an opportunity for more effective, targeted drug therapies—treating bacterial infections at the species level. Using an open drug discovery platform, we identified compounds that inhibit the newly recognised pathogen M chimaera. The existing evidence base is poor and the option for expensive drug discovery is improbable; therefore, we have also found options for drug repurposing. Future in-vivo efficacy studies will reveal whether these findings result in new, targeted treatment regimens for M chimaera.

Therefore, F-SLOH demonstrates tremendous therapeutic potential for treating AD in its early stage.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers and phosphorylated Tau aggregates are crucial pathological events or factors that cause progressive neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current medications for AD have failed to halt, much less reverse this neurodegenerative disorder; therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of effective and safe drugs for AD therapy. In the present study, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of an Aβ-oligomer-targeted fluorescent probe, F-SLOH, was extensively investigated in 5XFAD and 3XTg-AD mouse models. We have shown that F-SLOH exhibits an efficient inhibitory activity against Aβ aggregation in vivo, and acts as an effective theranostic agent for the treatment of multiple neuropathological changes in AD mouse models. F-SLOH has been found to significantly reduce not only the levels of Aβ oligomers, Tau aggregates and plaques but also the levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its metabolites via autophagy lysosomal degradation pathway (ALP) in the brains of 5XFAD and 3XTg-AD mice. It also reduces astrocyte activation and microgliosis ultimately alleviating neuro-inflammation. Furthermore, F-SLOH mitigates hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregates, synaptic deficits and ameliorates synaptic memory function, and cognitive impairment in AD mouse models. The mechanistic studies have shown that F-SLOH promotes the clearance of C-terminal fragment 15 (CTF15) of APP and Paired helical filaments of Tau (PHF1) in stable cell models via the activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). Moreover, F-SLOH promotes ALP and lysosomal biogenesis for the clearance of soluble, insoluble Aβ, and phospho Tau. Our results unambiguously reveal effective etiological capabilities of theranostic F-SLOH to target and intervene multiple neuropathological changes in AD mouse models.

"Sociodemographic inequalities in uranium and other metals in community water systems across the USA, 2006–11: a cross-sectional study",/articles/sociodemographic-inequalities-uranium-and-other-metals-community-water-systems-across-usa,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 6 by developing estimates of regulated metals in community water systems, which can be used in future studies, and by showing that there are significant sociodemographic inequalities in public water uranium concentrations.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Background: The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently sets maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for ten metals or metalloids in public drinking water systems. Our objective was to estimate metal concentrations in community water systems (CWSs) across the USA, to establish if sociodemographic or regional inequalities in the metal concentrations exist, and to identify patterns of concentrations for these metals as a mixture. Methods: We evaluated routine compliance monitoring records for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, selenium, thallium, and uranium, collected from 2006–11 (2000–11 for uranium; timeframe based on compliance monitoring requirements) by the US EPA in support of their second and third Six-Year Reviews for CWSs. Arsenic, barium, chromium, selenium, and uranium (detectable in >10% records) were included in the main analyses (subgroup and metal mixture analyses; arsenic data reported previously). We compared the mean, 75th percentile, and 95th percentile contaminant concentrations and the percentage of CWSs with concentrations exceeding the MCL across subgroups (region, sociodemographic county-cluster, size of population served, source water type, and CWSs exclusively serving correctional facilities). We evaluated patterns in CWS metal concentration estimate profiles via hierarchical cluster analysis. We created an online interactive map and dashboard of estimated CWS metal concentrations for use in future analyses. Findings: Average metal concentrations were available for a total of 37 915 CWSs across the USA. The total number of monitoring records available was approximately 297 000 for arsenic, 165 000 for barium, 167 000 for chromium, 165 000 for selenium, and 128 000 for uranium. The percentage of analysed CWSs with average concentrations exceeding the MCL was 2·6% for arsenic (MCL=10 μg/L; nationwide mean 1·77 μg/L; n=36 798 CWSs), 2·1% for uranium (MCL=30 μg/L; nationwide mean 4·37 μg/L; n=14 503 CWSs), and less than 0·1% for the other metals. The number of records with detections was highest for uranium (63·1%). 75th and 95th percentile concentrations for uranium, chromium, barium, and selenium were highest for CWSs serving Semi-Urban, Hispanic communities, CWSs reliant on groundwater, and CWSs in the Central Midwest. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two distinct clusters: an arsenic–uranium–selenium cluster and a barium–chromium cluster. Interpretations: Uranium is an under-recognised contaminant in CWSs. Metal concentrations (including uranium) are elevated in CWSs serving Semi-Urban, Hispanic communities independent of location or region, highlighting environmental justice concerns.

However, simultaneously balancing these five critical factors of OSCs toward commercialization is extremely challenging. Herein, a green-solvent-processable and open-air-printable self-assembly strategy is demonstrated to synchronously simplify the device architecture, improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and enhance the shelf, thermal as well as light illumination stability of OSCs. The cathode interlayer (CIL)-free self-assembled OSCs exhibit the PCE of 15.5%, higher than that of traditional inverted OSCs of 13.0%, which is among the top values for both CIL-free self-assembled OSCs and open-air blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs. The remarkable enhancements are mainly ascribed to the finely self-assembly, subtly controlled donor/acceptor aggregation rate, and delicately manipulated vertical morphology. Besides, this strategy enables 13.2% efficiency on device area of 0.98 cm2, implying its potential for scalability. These findings demonstrate that this strategy can close the lab-to-fab gap of OSCs toward commercialized cheap, stable, efficient, scalable, and eco-friendly OSCs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The authors discuss the implications for financial and health services planning, as well as quality of life.
","Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions","Background: This study quantifies survival time after dementia diagnosis and assesses mechanisms driving differences across race/ethnicity to inform care and financial planning. Methods: Using 100% Medicare claims data, we identified 670,955 beneficiaries with incident dementia diagnosis in 2001 and followed them through 2018. We quantified racial/ethnic differences in post-diagnosis survival and for subgroups defined by sex, age at diagnosis, socio-economic status, and geography. Additionally, we investigated racial/ethnic time trends in 5-year mortality risk of 8,080,098 beneficiaries with incident dementia in years 2001-2013. Findings: Hispanics and Asians diagnosed with dementia had 40% lower mortality risk and African Americans had 13% lower mortality risk than Whites. There was no difference between American Indians/Alaska Natives and Whites. Racial/ethnic differences were of similar size in sex, age at diagnosis, and urban/rural subgroups; however, the survival advantage between non-Whites and Whites was larger among low-income beneficiaries. State differences in mortality among Blacks were consistent with a Southern divide but not for Asians and Hispanics. The Asian-White and Hispanic-White mortality differences decreased 2001 to 2013. Interpretation: Racial/ethnic survival differences after dementia diagnosis have implications for magnitude of financial impact of dementia on individuals and families. Quantifying survival differences and changes over time informs family, community, and societal level long-term care planning for a large and growing population of persons living with dementia. Variation in the size of racial/ethnic differences by economic status and geographic location provides opportunities for targeted strategies to reduce economic consequences and improve care and quality of life after dementia diagnosis.

This paper grapples with this by combining well-respected and empirically validated estimates of technology diffusion together with energy models. Its purpose is to illuminate some of Ireland's challenges associated with meeting these targets. The results show Ireland's electric vehicle and residential retrofitting goals would require rates of technology diffusion that are well beyond the historical rates internationally of even the most successful transformations to date. This result calls Ireland's ambitions into question. Drawing on the theory of technology diffusion, the paper also provides insights into additional complementary policies that Ireland might consider in order to accelerate diffusion of key technologies. The paper demonstrates the means and the value of drawing on historical precedents to help determine the feasibility of future transition scenarios.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background: The influence of rising global temperatures on malaria dynamics and distribution remains controversial, especially in central highland regions. We aimed to address this subject by studying the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of malaria and the effect of climate change on malaria transmission over 27 years in Hainan, an island province in China. Methods: For this longitudinal cohort study, we used a decades-long dataset of malaria incidence reports from Hainan, China, to investigate the pattern of malaria transmission in Hainan relative to temperature and the incidence at increasing altitudes. Climatic data were obtained from the local meteorological stations in Hainan during 1984–2010 and the WorldClim dataset. A temperature-dependent R0 model and negative binomial generalised linear model were used to decipher the relationship between climate factors and malaria incidence in the tropical region. Findings: Over the past few decades, the annual peak incidence has appeared earlier in the central highland regions but later in low-altitude regions in Hainan, China. Results from the temperature-dependent model showed that these long-term changes of incidence peak timing are linked to rising temperatures (of about 1·5°C). Further, a 1°C increase corresponds to a change in cases of malaria from –5·6% (95% CI –4·5 to –6·6) to –9·2% (95% CI –7·6 to –10·9) from the northern plain regions to the central highland regions during the rainy season. In the dry season, the change in cases would be 4·6% (95% CI 3·7 to 5·5) to 11·9% (95% CI 9·8 to 14·2) from low-altitude areas to high-altitude areas. Interpretation: Our study empirically supports the idea that increasing temperatures can generate opposing effects on malaria dynamics for lowland and highland regions. This should be further investigated and incorporated into future modelling, disease burden calculations, and malaria control, with attention for central highland regions under climate change.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Understanding cultural differences between geographical regions is essential in delivering culturally appropriate healthcare. We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of diverse clients using the Far North Mental Health and Wellbeing Service (FNS) and the Central West Health and Wellbeing Service (CWS). Methods: We conducted a cohort study within Queensland, Australia, on all clients who received a mental health therapy session at either the FNS or the CWS. Patient data was prospective data collected form July 2019 to December 2020. Findings: There were1202 clients, with a median number of individual contacts per-client of 3.0 (IQR 2.0-6.0). There was 428 (35.6% 95% CI 32.90-38.39) males and 772 (64.2% 95% CI 61.44-66.94) females with a median age across the genders of 38.0 (IQR 28.0-51.0). There was 505 (42.0% 95% CI 39.20-44.86) identifying as Indigenous and 697 (58.0% 95% CI 55.14-60.80) as non-Indigenous Australians. The FNS had a significantly higher proportion of Indigenous clients (n=484; 54.8% 95% CI 51.46-58.13) as compared to the CWS (n=21; 6.6% 95% CI 4.12-9.89). Of the 1202 clients, 946 (78.7% 95% CI 76.28-80.99) had a socio-economic classification of ‘most disadvantaged’, consisting of 740 (83.8%) clients from the FNS and 206 (64.6%) clients from the CWS. The majority of presentations were for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n=568; 47.3%), followed by mood affective disorders (n=310; 25.8%). The overall number of treatments strategies employed was 10798, equalling a median of 6.0 (IQR 4.0-9.0) strategies per-client, with the leading strategies being counselling/psychosocial (n=1394; 12.9%), reflective listening (n=1191; 11.0%), and strengths based reasoning (n=1116; 10.3%). There were 511 (42.5%) clients who completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10/K5), with 493 (41.0%) clients not offered as deemed not culturally appropriate by the treating team. The mean initial K10/K5 score was 23.7 (SD 9.4) which significantly decreased (p<0.001) to 18.0 (SD 10.0) at final consultation. Interpretation: This study highlighted client socioeconomic differences between two geographically remote mental health services.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to pandemics, including to the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, since it causes high mortality and specially, the loss of elderly Indigenous individuals. Methods: The epidemiological data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection or other etiologic agents (OEA) among Brazilian Indigenous peoples during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from a Brazilian Ministry of Health open-access database to perform an observational study. Considering only Indigenous individuals diagnosed with SARS by COVID-19, the epidemiology data were also evaluated as risk of death. The type of sample collection for virus screening, demographic profile, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical evolution were evaluated. The primary outcome was considered the death in the Brazilian Indigenous individuals and the secondary outcome, the characteristics of Brazilian Indigenous infected by SARS-CoV-2 or OEA, as the need for intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation support. The statistical analysis was done using Logistic Regression Model. Alpha of 0.05. Findings: A total of 3,122 cases of Indigenous individuals with SARS in Brazil were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 1,994 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 730/1,816 (40.2%) of them died. The death rate among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 was three-fold increased when compared to the group of individuals with OEA. Several symptoms (myalgia, loss of smell, and sore throat) and comorbidities (cardiopathy, systemic arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group when compared to Indigenous individuals with OEA. Similar profile was observed considering the risk of death among the Indigenous individuals with COVID-19 who presented several symptoms (oxygen saturation <95%, dyspnea, and respiratory distress) and comorbidities (renal disorders, cardiopathy, and diabetes mellitus). The multivariate analysis was significant in differentiating between the COVID-19-positive and non-COVID-19 patients [X2(7)=65.187; P-value<0.001]. Among the patients’ features, the following contributed in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19: age [≥43 years-old [y.o.]; OR=1.984 (95%CI=1.480-2.658)]; loss of smell [OR=2.373 (95%CI=1.461-3.854)]; presence of previous respiratory disorders [OR=0.487; 95%CI=0.287-0.824)]; and fever [OR=1.445 (95%CI=1.082-1.929)]. Also, the multivariate analysis was able to predict the risk of death [X2(9)=293.694; P-value<0.001]. Among the patients’ features, the following contributed in relation to the risk of death: male gender [OR=1.507 (95%CI=1.010-2.250)]; age [≥60 y.o.; OR=3.377 (95%CI=2.292-4.974)]; the need for ventilatory support [invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=24.050 (95%CI=12.584-45.962) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation; OR=2.249 (95%CI=1.378-3.671)]; dyspnea [OR=2.053 (95%CI=1.196-3.522)]; oxygen saturation <95% [OR=1.691 (95%CI=1.050-2.723)]; myalgia [OR=0.423 (95%CI=0.191-0.937)]; and the presence of kidney disorders [OR=3.135 (95%CI=1.144-8.539)]. Interpretation: The Brazilian Indigenous peoples are in a vulnerable situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Several factors were associated with enhanced risk of death, as male sex, older age (≥60 y.o.), and need for ventilatory support; also, other factors might help to differentiate SARS by COVID-19 or by OEA, as older age (≥43 y.o.), loss of smell, and fever.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face a double burden of malnutrition (DBM), whereby overnutrition and undernutrition coexist within the same individual, household, or population. This analysis investigates global inequalities in household-level DBM, expressed as a stunted child with an overweight mother, and its association with economic, social, and political globalisation across country income and household wealth. Methods: We pooled anthropometric and demographic data for 1 132 069 children (aged <5 years) and their mothers (aged 15–49 years) from 189 Demographic and Health Surveys in 55 LMICs between 1992 and 2018. These data were combined with country-level data on economic, social, and political globalisation from the Konjunkturforschungsstelle Globalisation Index and gross national income (GNI) from the World Bank. Multivariate associations between DBM and household wealth, GNI, and globalisation and their interactions were tested using multilevel logistic regression models with country and year fixed-effects and robust standard errors clustered by country. Findings: The probability of DBM was higher among richer households in poorer LMICs and poorer households in richer LMICs. Economic globalisation was associated with higher odds of DBM among the poorest households (odds ratio 1·49, 95% CI 1·20–1·86) compared with the richest households. These associations attenuated as GNI increased. Social globalisation was associated with higher odds of DBM (1·39, 95% CI 1·16–1·65), independently of household wealth or country income. No associations were identified between political globalisation and DBM. Interpretation: Increases in economic and social globalisation were associated with higher DBM, although the impacts of economic globalisation were mostly realised by the world's poorest. The economic patterning of DBM observed in this study calls for subpopulation-specific double-duty actions, which should further aim to mitigate the potential negative and unequal impacts of globalisation.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 13: Climate action,"Consumers’ tendency to waste suboptimal food poses challenges for sustainable food systems. In the case of aging produce, consumers often experience a conflict between the goals of not wanting to waste food and food safety. In addition to safety, perceived healthfulness can influence the decision between consumption and disposal of (suboptimal) food items. Using an online information experiment on the safety and healthfulness of aging produce, this study investigates consumers’ willingness to consume aging produce. Results show that providing information on safety or healthfulness results in increased safety and health perception, which in turn increases willingness to consume aging produce. In addition, consumers with lower food disgust sensitivity, a decision style characterized by less reliance on expiration dates, and a preference for vegetarian dishes are more willing to consume aging produce. This study adds to the growing body of literature discussing how to increase the consumption of suboptimal foods. The results imply that informing consumers about safety and healthfulness can be a viable path to increase the consumption of aging produce at home.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to strengthen national surveillance systems to protect a globally connected world. In low-income and middle-income countries, zoonotic disease surveillance has advanced considerably in the past two decades. However, surveillance efforts often prioritise urban and adjacent rural communities. Communities in remote rural areas have had far less support despite having routine exposure to zoonotic diseases due to frequent contact with domestic and wild animals, and restricted access to health care. Limited disease surveillance in remote rural areas is a crucial gap in global health security. Although this point has been made in the past, practical solutions on how to implement surveillance efficiently in these resource-limited and logistically challenging settings have yet to be discussed. We highlight why investing in disease surveillance in remote rural areas of low-income and middle-income countries will benefit the global community and review current approaches. Using semi-arid regions in Kenya as a case study, we provide a practical approach by which surveillance in remote rural areas can be strengthened and integrated into existing systems.

However, the extent to which phthalate restrictions will alleviate these health concerns remains unclear. Here, we employed a sequential modeling approach to evaluate the impact that a series of restrictions would have on the mass of phthalates in the use phase, indoor concentrations, exposure, and the attributable disease burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity in adults. We show that, compared with the business-as-usual scenario, the implementation of the strongest restriction on the concerned phthalates in 2016 can decrease the use of phthalates by up to 91.2%, indoor airborne phthalate concentrations by 93.8%, and indoor dust-phase phthalate concentrations by 90.2% by 2031. Correspondingly, the decrease in phthalate exposure would result in a health benefit of 134.6 billion CNY.

Multisystemic therapy for child abuse and neglect: Parental stress and parental mental health as predictors of change in child neglect,/articles/multisystemic-therapy-child-abuse-and-neglect-parental-stress-and-parental-mental-health,How poor mental health in parents can contribute to child neglect..,Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Despite high prevalence, child neglect has long been passed over in research. Serious long-term consequences call for effective intervention programs. However, as a result of the lack of research, there is a lack of effective interventions. In order to develop such intervention programs and to maximize the effectiveness of existing programs, it is necessary to examine what factors are related to the reduction of neglect and, subsequently, what change mechanisms their effectiveness is based on. Objective: In this intervention study we investigated whether changes in parental mental health and parental stress after Multisystemic Therapy for Child Abuse and Neglect (MST-CAN), an effective evidence-based intervention program for child neglect, are related to changes in child neglect. Participants and setting: Study participants were 144 parent-child dyads participating in the MST-CAN program. Methods: We analyzed changes from pre- to post-treatment in child neglect, parental mental health, and parental stress, and conducted a multiple regression analysis to examine whether changes in parental mental health and parental stress predict changes in child neglect. Result: Our results showed that child neglect, as well as parental stress, significantly decreased and parental mental health significantly improved during the program. While improvements in parental mental health were not related to the reduction of child neglect, a decrease in parental stress significantly predicted the reduction of child neglect. Conclusion: These findings suggest that parental stress might be a promising target for evidence-based intervention programs to reduce the occurrence of child neglect.

The model output for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, Cl, Fe3+, and Zn during the 10-year period 2090–2099 was compared to the model output during the 10-year period 2006–2015, for which measured meteorological data was used as input. Changes in thermocline, chemocline and water outflow were also evaluated. The results indicate that the water outflow from the pit lake will increase, as well as the number of days when the temperature in the mixolimnion exceeds 12 °C. The largest changes are seen for the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 8.5). A small increase in Zn outflow (4.4%) could be observed for the RCP 8.5 emission scenario compared to the RCP 2.6 scenario. The results also indicate that the stratification of the lake is relatively stable, and it is predicted to remain meromictic for all climate scenarios. However, a sensitivity analysis indicates that a reduction of groundwater inflow element concentrations by 25–50% may result in a weakened stratification of the lake. Minor dilution could be observed in the monimolimnion of the lake as the modelled Cl concentration decreased by ∼0.3 mg/L in the RCP 8.5 emission scenario compared to the 2006–2015 period.

For Ukrainian pediatric cancer patients receiving care outside of their nation's borders on February 24, 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine compounded these problems. Based on conversations with patients and parents, we evaluated the psychosocial impact of war on pediatric Ukrainian cancer patients and their families who had left their country prior to the onset of the conflict to undergo treatment of pediatric malignancies at our medical center. These families shared with us the problems they have experienced following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Their concerns can be summarized in four categories: 1. Emotional stress experienced by the patients, families and relatives related to the dangers of war, 2. Difficulties in obtaining previous hospital records in Ukraine, 3. Medical expenses, and 4. Uncertainty regarding the patient's and their family's future and the ability of the children to ever return to their homes. Psychosocial distress relating to the violence of war will hopefully pass in near future, but our pediatric patients and their families will continue to face stressors related to displacement and financial concerns for some time to come.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
Soluble TREM2 in CSF and its association with other biomarkers and cognition in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal observational study,/articles/soluble-trem2-csf-and-its-association-other-biomarkers-and-cognition-autosomal-dominant,"An article on Alzheimer's disease progression, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the dynamics of soluble TREM2 and its association with amyloid and tau markers, neuroimaging features, and cognition.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Therapeutic modulation of TREM2-dependent microglial function might provide an additional strategy to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although studies in animal models suggest that TREM2 is protective against Alzheimer's pathology, its effect on tau pathology and its potential beneficial role in people with Alzheimer's disease is still unclear. Our aim was to study associations between the dynamics of soluble TREM2, as a biomarker of TREM2 signalling, and amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, tau-related pathology, neuroimaging markers, and cognitive decline, during the progression of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Methods: We did a longitudinal analysis of data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study, which includes families with a history of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Participants aged over 18 years who were enrolled in DIAN between Jan 1, 2009, and July 31, 2019, were categorised as either carriers of pathogenic variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes (n=155) or non-carriers (n=93). We measured amounts of cleaved soluble TREM2 using a novel immunoassay in CSF samples obtained every 2 years from participants who were asymptomatic (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]=0) and annually for those who were symptomatic (CDR>0). CSF concentrations of Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated on threonine 181 (p-tau) were measured by validated immunoassays. Predefined neuroimaging measurements were total cortical uptake of Pittsburgh compound B PET (PiB-PET), cortical thickness in the precuneus ascertained by MRI, and hippocampal volume determined by MRI. Cognition was measured using a validated cognitive composite (including DIAN word list test, logical memory delayed recall, digit symbol coding test [total score], and minimental status examination). We based our statistical analysis on univariate and bivariate linear mixed effects models. Findings: In carriers of pathogenic variants, a high amyloid burden at baseline, represented by low CSF Aβ42 (β=–4·28 × 10–2 [SE 0·013], p=0·0012), but not high cortical uptake in PiB-PET (β=–5·51 × 10–3 [0·011], p=0·63), was the only predictor of an augmented annual rate of subsequent increase in soluble TREM2. Augmented annual rates of increase in soluble TREM2 were associated with a diminished rate of decrease in amyloid deposition, as measured by Aβ42 in CSF (r=0·56 [0·22], p=0·011), in presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants, and with diminished annual rate of increase in PiB-PET (r=–0·67 [0·25], p=0·0060) in symptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants. Presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants with annual rates of increase in soluble TREM2 lower than the median showed a correlation between enhanced annual rates of increase in p-tau in CSF and augmented annual rates of increase in PiB-PET signal (r=0·45 [0·21], p=0·035), that was not observed in those with rates of increase in soluble TREM2 higher than the median. Furthermore, presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants with rates of increase in soluble TREM2 above or below the median had opposite associations between Aβ42 in CSF and PiB-PET uptake when assessed longitudinally. Augmented annual rates of increase in soluble TREM2 in presymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants correlated with decreased cortical shrinkage in the precuneus (r=0·46 [0·22]), p=0·040) and diminished cognitive decline (r=0·67 [0·22], p=0·0020). Interpretation: Our findings in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease position the TREM2 response within the amyloid cascade immediately after the first pathological changes in Aβ aggregation and further support the role of TREM2 on Aβ plaque deposition and compaction. Furthermore, these findings underpin a beneficial effect of TREM2 on Aβ deposition, Aβ-dependent tau pathology, cortical shrinkage, and cognitive decline. Soluble TREM2 could, therefore, be a key marker for clinical trial design and interpretation. Efforts to develop TREM2-boosting therapies are ongoing.

Editor's Choice – Effect of Carotid Endarterectomy on 20 Year Incidence of Recorded Dementia: A Randomised Trial,/articles/editors-choice-%E2%80%93-effect-carotid-endarterectomy-20-year-incidence-recorded-dementia,"This article explores whether operations for carotid artery diseases reduce the risk of dementia.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Objective: Stroke and carotid atherosclerosis are associated with dementia. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces stroke risk, although its effect on later dementia is uncertain. Participants in the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST-1), randomly allocated to immediate vs. deferral of CEA (i.e., no intervention unless or until triggered by ipsilateral transient ischaemic attack or stroke), were followed, to study effects on dementia. Methods: From 1993 to 2003, ACST-1 included 3 120 participants with asymptomatic tight carotid stenosis. All UK and Swedish patients (n = 1 601; 796 immediate vs. 805 deferral) were followed with trial records, national electronic health record linkage, and (UK only) by post and telephone. Cumulative incidence and competing risk analyses were used to measure the effects of risk factors and CEA on dementia risk. Intention to treat analyses yielded hazard ratios (HRs; immediate vs. deferral) of dementia. Results: The median follow up was 19.4 years (interquartile range 16.9 – 21.7). Dementia was recorded in 107 immediate CEA patients and 115 allocated delayed surgery; 1 290 patients died (1 091 [538 vs. 536] before any dementia diagnosis). Dementia incidence rose with age and with female sex (men: 8.3% aged < 70 years at trial entry vs. 15.1% aged ≥ 70; women: 15.1% aged < 70 years at trial entry vs. 22.4% aged ≥ 70 years) and was higher in those with pre-existing cerebral infarction (silent or with prior symptoms; 20.2% vs. 13.6%). Dementia risk was similar in both randomised groups: 6.7% vs. 6.6% at 10 years and 14.3% vs. 15.5% at 20 years, respectively. The dementia HR was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 – 1.28; p =.89), with no heterogeneity in the neutral effect of immediate CEA on dementia related to age, carotid stenosis, blood pressure, diabetes, country of residence, or medical treatments at trial entry (heterogeneity values p >.05). Conclusion: CEA was not associated with significant reductions in the long term hazards of dementia, but the CI did not exclude a proportional benefit or hazard of about 25%.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Dementia risk in a diverse population: A single-region nested case-control study in the East End of London,/articles/dementia-risk-diverse-population-single-region-nested-case-control-study-east-end-london,"An article on dementia risk, in the context of SDGs 3 and 10, focusing specifically on the association between ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and dementia risk.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Most evidence about dementia risk comes from relatively affluent people of White European ancestry. We aimed to determine the association between ethnicity, area level socioeconomic deprivation and dementia risk, and the extent to which variation in risk might be attributable to known modifiable clinical risk factors and health behaviours. Methods: In this nested case-control study, we analysed data from primary care medical records of a population of 1,016,277 from four inner East London boroughs, United Kingdom, collected between 2009 and 2018. The outcome measures were odds ratios for dementia according to ethnicity and deprivation, before and after the addition of major modifiable risk factors for dementia; and weighted population attributable risk for comparison between individual risk factors. Findings: We identified 4137 dementia cases and 15,754 matched controls (mean age for cases and controls were 80·7 years, (SD 8·7); 81·3 years, (SD 8·9) respectively, range 27–103). Black and South Asian ethnicity were both associated with increased risk of dementia relative to White (odds ratios [95% CI]: Black 1·43 [1·31–1·56]; South Asian 1.17 [1·06–1·29]). Area-level deprivation was independently associated with an increased risk of dementia in a dose-dependent manner. Black and South Asian ethnicity were both associated with a younger age at dementia diagnosis (odds ratios [95%CI]: 0·70 [0·61–0·80] and 0·55 [0·47–0·65], respectively). Population attributable risk was higher for ethnicity (9·7%) and deprivation (11·7%) than for any established modifiable risk factor in this population. Interpretation: Ethnicity and area-level deprivation are independently associated with dementia risk in East London. This effect may not be attributable to the effect of known risk factors.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: There is an urgent clinical need for evidence-based psychosocial interventions for people with mild dementia. We aimed to determine the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of Journeying through Dementia (JtD), an intervention designed to promote wellbeing and independence in people with mild dementia. Methods: We did a single-blind, parallel group, individually randomised, phase 3 trial at 13 National Health Service sites across England. People with mild dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≥18) who lived in the community were eligible for inclusion. Patients were centrally randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the JtD intervention plus standard care (JtD group) or standard care only (standard care group). Randomisation was stratified by study site. The JtD intervention included 12 group and four one-to-one sessions, delivered in the community at each site. The primary endpoint was Dementia Related Quality of Life (DEMQOL) 8 months after randomisation, assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Only outcome assessors were masked to group assignment. A cost-effectiveness analysis reported cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from a UK NHS and social care perspective. The study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN17993825. Findings: Between Nov 30, 2016, and Aug 31, 2018, 1183 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 480 (41%) participants were randomly assigned: 241 (50%) to the JtD group and 239 (50%) to the standard care group. Intervention adherence was very good: 165 (68%) of 241 participants in the JtD group attended at least ten of the 16 sessions. Mean DEMQOL scores at 8 months were 93·3 (SD 13·0) for the JtD group and 91·9 (SD 14·6) for the control group. Difference in means was 0·9 (95% CI –1·2 to 3·0; p=0·38) after adjustment for covariates, lower than that identified as clinically meaningful. Incremental cost per QALY ranged from £88 000 to –£205 000, suggesting that JtD was not cost-effective. Unrelated serious adverse events were reported by 40 (17%) patients in the JtD group and 35 (15%) patients in the standard care group. Interpretation: In common with other studies, the JtD intervention was not proven effective. However, this complex trial successfully recruited and retained people with dementia without necessarily involving carers. Additionally, people with dementia were actively involved as participants and study advisers throughout. More research into methods of measuring small, meaningful changes in this population is needed. Questions remain regarding how services can match the complex, diverse, and individual needs of people with mild dementia, and how interventions to meet such needs can be delivered at scale.

We then highlight the neuroprotective mechanisms of melatonin therapy derived from preclinical studies. These mechanisms include the alleviation of amyloid-related burden, neurofibrillary tangle accumulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired neuroplasticity and neurotransmission. We further illustrate the beneficial effects of melatonin on behavior in animal models of AD. Next, we discuss the clinical effects of melatonin on sleep, cognition, behavior, psychiatric symptoms, electroencephalography findings, and molecular biomarkers in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD. We then explore the effectiveness of novel melatonin-based therapies.

The multimodal action of genistein in Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases,/articles/multimodal-action-genistein-alzheimers-and-other-age-related-diseases,"In this review, we aim to discuss the multimodal action of genistein as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloid β, and autophagy promoter, which could be responsible for the genistein beneficial effect on Alzheimer's.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Genistein is a phytoestrogen that, due to its structural similarity with estrogen, can both mimic and antagonize estrogen effects. Early analysis proved that at high concentrations, genistein inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation, thereby suggesting an anticancer activity. Since then, many discoveries have identified the genistein mechanism of action, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, as well as angiogenesis, and metastasis inhibition. In this review, we aim to discuss the multimodal action of genistein as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloid β, and autophagy promoter, which could be responsible for the genistein beneficial effect on Alzheimer's. Furthermore, we pinpoint the main signal transduction pathways that are known to be modulated by genistein. Genistein has thus several beneficial effects in several diseases, many of them associated with age, such as the above mentioned Alzheimer disease. Indeed, the beneficial effects of genistein for health promotion depend on each multimodality.

Corn tassel tea, which has a high phenolic component content (677.7 mg GAE/L), received less sensory acceptance due to its bitter aftertaste. Therefore, walnut shell tea containing moderate phenolic content was the most preferred tea blend. Significant effects of different infusion temperatures and times on the color indices of teas were also demonstrated. The sensory properties of samples infused for 3 min were more acceptable. The highest correlation coefficients were calculated between total phenolic compounds and subjective odor parameters.

Although PWH with TCL diagnosed between 1996 and 2009 experienced a low 5-year survival probability at 0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13, 0.41), we observed a marked improvement in their survival when diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 (0.69; 95% CI: 0.48, 1; P = .04) in contrast to TCLs among PWoH (0.45; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.51; P = .53). Similarly, PWH with ALCLs diagnosed between 1996 and 2009 were associated with a conspicuously inferior 5-year survival probability (0.17; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.42) and consistently lagged behind A-BCL subtypes such as Burkitt’s (0.43; 95% CI:0.33, 0.57; P = .09) and DLBCL (0.17; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.46; P = .11) and behind HL (0.57; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.65; P < .0001). Despite a small number, those diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 experienced a remarkable improvement in survival (0.67; 95% CI: 0.3, 1) in comparison with PWoH (0.76; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.87; P = .58). Thus, our analysis confirms improved overall survival for aggressive B- and T-cell malignancies among PWH in the last decade.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"People ageing with HIV face crucial challenges that can compromise their long-term health, one of which is stigma. HIV-related stigma can interact with other coexistent inequities to create a unique oppression system that results in traumatic experiences. This intersectionality of stigmas represents a new inequality that is greater than the sum of the original component inequalities. In this Series paper we review the literature regarding the intersectionality of HIV-related and ageing-related stigma and health-related quality of life among people ageing with HIV in China, Europe, and Latin America—three regions that represent distinct epidemiological and cultural trends in terms of HIV and ageing. Substantial gaps in the literature were identified, in particular a scarcity of data from Latin America. We also found inconsistencies between countries in terms of definitions and reporting practices related to people ageing with HIV.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Although people with HIV are living longer, as they age they remain disproportionately burdened with multimorbidity that is exacerbated in resource-poor settings. The geroscience hypothesis postulates that a discrete set of between five and ten hallmarks of biological ageing drive multimorbidity, but these processes have not been systematically examined in the context of people with HIV. We examine four major hallmarks of ageing (macromolecular damage, senescence, inflammation, and stem-cell dysfunction) as gerodrivers in the context of people with HIV. As a counterbalance, we introduce healthy ageing, physiological reserve, intrinsic capacity, and resilience as promoters of geroprotection that counteract gerodrivers. We discuss emerging geroscience-based diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, and provide examples based on recent advances in cellular senescence, and other, non-pharmacological approaches. Finally, we present a conceptual model of biological ageing in the general population and in people with HIV that integrates gerodrivers and geroprotectors as modulators of homoeostatic reserves and organ function over the lifecourse.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Outcomes of people living with HIV after hospital discharge: a systematic review and meta-analysis,/articles/outcomes-people-living-hiv-after-hospital-discharge-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis,"An Article in support of SDG 3, estimating the frequency of negative post-discharge outcomes, and assessing risk factors for such outcomes, in people with HIV.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The identification and appropriate management of people with advanced HIV disease is a key component in the HIV response. People with HIV who are hospitalised are at a higher risk of death, a risk that might persist after discharge. The aims of this study were to estimate the frequency of negative post-discharge outcomes, and to determine risk factors for such outcomes in people with HIV. Methods: Using a broad search strategy combining terms for hospital discharge and HIV infection, we searched MEDLINE via PubMed and Embase from Jan 1, 2003 to Nov 30, 2021 to identify studies reporting outcomes among people with HIV following discharge from hospital. We estimated pooled proportions of readmissions and deaths after hospital discharge using random-effects models. We also did subgroup analyses by setting, region, duration of follow-up, and advanced HIV status at admission, and sensitivity analyses to assess heterogeneity. Findings: We obtained data from 29 cohorts, which reported outcomes of people living with HIV after hospital discharge in 92 781 patients. The pooled proportion of patients readmitted to hospital after discharge was 18·8% (95% CI 15·3–22·3) and 14·1% (10·8–17·3) died post-discharge. In sensitivity analyses, no differences were identified in the proportion of patients who were readmitted or died when comparing studies published before 2016 with those published after 2016. Post-discharge mortality was higher in studies from Africa (23·1% [16·5–29·7]) compared with the USA (7·5% [4·4–10·6]). For studies that reported both post-discharge mortality and readmission, the pooled proportion of patients who had this composite adverse outcome was 31·7% (23·9–39·5). Heterogeneity was moderate, and largely explained by patient status and linkage to care. Reported risk factors for readmission included low CD4 cell count at admission, longer length of stay, discharge against medical advice, and not linking to care following discharge; inpatient treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) during hospitalisation was protective of post-discharge mortality. Interpretation: More than a quarter of patients with HIV had an adverse outcome after hospital discharge with no evidence of improvement in the past 15 years. This systematic review highlights the importance of ensuring post-discharge referral and appropriate management, including ART, to reduce mortality and readmission to hospital among this group of high-risk patients.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Ethnic inequities in stroke care access have been reported internationally but the impact on outcomes remains unclear. In New Zealand, data on ethnic stroke inequities and resultant effects on outcomes are generally limited and conflicting. Methods: In a prospective, nationwide, multi-centre observational study, we recruited consecutive adult patients with confirmed stroke from 28 hospitals between 1 May and 31 October 2018. Patient outcomes: favourable functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-2); quality of life (EQ-5D-3L); stroke/vascular events; and death at three, six and 12 months. Process measures: access to reperfusion therapies, stroke-units, investigations, secondary prevention, rehabilitation. Multivariate regression analyses assessed associations between ethnicity and outcomes and process measures. Findings: The cohort comprised 2,379 patients (median age 78 (IQR 66-85); 51·2% male; 76·7% European, 11·5% Māori, 4·8% Pacific peoples, 4·8% Asian). Non-Europeans were younger, had more risk factors, had reduced access to acute stroke units (aOR=0·78, 95%CI, 0·60-0·97), and were less likely to receive a swallow screen within 24 hours of arrival (aOR=0·72, 0·53-0·99) or MRI imaging (OR=0·66, 0·52-0·85). Māori were less frequently prescribed anticoagulants (OR=0·68, 0·47-0·98). Pacific peoples received greater risk factor counselling. Fewer non-Europeans had a favourable mRS score at three (aOR=0·67, 0·47-0·96), six (aOR=0·63, 0·40-0·98) and 12 months (aOR=0·56, 0·36-0·88), and more Māori had died by 12 months (aOR=1·76, 1·07-2·89). Interpretation: Non-Europeans, especially Māori, had poorer access to key stroke interventions and experience poorer outcomes. Further optimisation of stroke care targeting high-priority populations are needed to achieve equity.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Analysis of health inequalities by ethnicity is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In Ecuador, similar to other Latin American countries, indigenous and afro-descendant populations have long been subject to racism, discrimination, and inequitable treatment. Although in recent years, Ecuador has made progress in health indicators, particularly those related to the coverage of Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (RMNCH) interventions, little is known as to whether inequalities by ethnicity persist. Methods: Analysis was based on two nationally representative health surveys (2004 and 2012). Ethnicity was self-reported and classified into three categories (Indigenous/Afro-Ecuadorian/Mixed ancestry). Coverage data for six RMNCH health interventions were stratified for each ethnic group by level of education, area of residence and wealth quintiles. Absolute inequality measures were computed and multivariate analysis using Poisson regression was undertaken. Findings: In 2012, 74.4% of women self-identifying as indigenous did not achieve the secondary level of education and 50.7% were in the poorest quintile (Q1); this profile was relatively unchanged since 2004. From 2004 to 2012, the coverage of RMNCH interventions increased for all ethnic groups, and absolute inequality decreased. However, in 2012, regardless of education level, area of residence and wealth quintiles, ethnic inequalities remained for almost all RMNCH interventions. Indigenous women had 24% lower prevalence of modern contraceptive use (Prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.76; 95% IC: 0.7–0.8); 28% lower prevalence of antenatal care (PR = 0.72; 95% IC: 0.6–0.8); and 35% lower prevalence of skilled birth attendance and institutional delivery (PR = 0.65; 95% IC: 0.6–0.7 and PR = 0.65; 95% IC: 0.6–0.7 respectively), compared with the majority ethnic group in the country. Interpretation: While the gaps have narrowed, indigenous people in Ecuador continue in a situation of structural racism and are left behind in terms of access to RMNCH interventions. Strategies to reduce ethnic inequalities in the coverage services need to be collaboratively redesigned/co-designed.

As development actors seek to attain the fifth and sixth Sustainable Development Goals, the need to measure WASH programs' contributions to gender equality outcomes is increasingly pressing. Yet the measurement of such outcomes remains challenging. This article describes and justifies the theory, concepts and decisions that underlie a recently developed quantitative measure of gender equality in WASH — the water, sanitation and hygiene gender equality measure (WASH-GEM) — and outlines key tensions navigated in its development. We developed the WASH-GEM through a collaborative, iterative process informed by a feminist perspective, critical review of relevant literature, pilot implementation and partner engagement. We report on five design considerations critical for the robust design of quantitative measures of social change: conceptual framing; measurement focus; measurement context; sectoral scope; and evaluative scope. We also define the WASH-GEM's five domains of measurement: Resources; Agency; Critical consciousness; Wellbeing; and Structures, and discuss how we balanced theoretical integrity with practical application and relevance to WASH. In reflecting on the WASH-GEM design, this article contributes to a critical discourse on methodological challenges and imperatives in the measurement of complex social change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production,"Background: Diet is a major modifiable risk factor for human health and overall consumption patterns affect planetary health. We aimed to quantify global, regional, and national consumption levels of animal-source foods (ASF) to inform intervention, surveillance, and policy priorities. Methods: Individual-level dietary surveys across 185 countries conducted between 1990 and 2018 were identified, obtained, standardised, and assessed among children and adults, jointly stratified by age, sex, education level, and rural versus urban residence. We included 499 discrete surveys (91·2% nationally or subnationally representative) with data for ASF (unprocessed red meat, processed meat, eggs, seafood, milk, cheese, and yoghurt), comprising 3·8 million individuals from 134 countries representing 95·2% of the world population in 2018. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to account for differences in survey methods and representativeness, time trends, and input data and modelling uncertainty, with five-fold cross-validation. Findings: In 2018, mean global intake per person of unprocessed red meat was 51 g/day (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 48–54; region-specific range 7–114 g/day); 17 countries (23·9% of the world's population) had mean intakes of at least one serving (100 g) per day. Global mean intake of processed meat was 17 g/day (95% UI 15–21 g/day; region-specific range 3–54 g/day); seafood, 28 g/day (27–30 g/day; 12–44 g/day); eggs, 21 g/day (18–24 g/day; 6–35 g/day); milk 88 g/day (84–93 g/day; 45–185 g/day); cheese, 8 g/day (8–10 g/day; 1–34 g/day); and yoghurt, 20 g/day (17–23 g/day; 7–84 g/day). Mean national intakes were at least one serving per day for processed meat (≥50 g/day) in countries representing 6·9% of the global population; for cheese (≥42 g/day) in 2·3%; for eggs (≥55 g/day) in 0·7%; for milk (≥245 g/day) in 0·3%; for seafood (≥100 g/day) in 0·8%; and for yoghurt (≥245 g/day) in less than 0·1%. Among the 25 most populous countries in 2018, total ASF intake was highest in Russia (5·8 servings per day), Germany (3·8 servings per day), and the UK (3·7 servings per day), and lowest in Tanzania (0·9 servings per day) and India (0·7 servings per day). Global and regional intakes of ASF were generally similar by sex. Compared with children, adults generally consumed more unprocessed red meat, seafood and cheese, and less milk; energy-adjusted intakes of other ASF were more similar. Globally, ASF intakes (servings per week) were higher among more-educated versus less-educated adults, with greatest global differences for milk (0·79), eggs (0·47), unprocessed red meat (0·42), cheese (0·28), seafood (0·28), yoghurt (0·22), and processed meat (0·21). This was also true for urban compared to rural areas, with largest global differences (servings per week) for unprocessed red meat (0·47), milk (0·38), and eggs (0·20). Between 1990 and 2018, global intakes (servings per week) increased for unprocessed red meat (1·20), eggs (1·18), milk (0·63), processed meat (0·50), seafood (0·44), and cheese (0·14). Interpretation: Our estimates of ASF consumption identify populations with both lower and higher than optimal intakes. These estimates can inform the targeting of intervention, surveillance, and policy priorities relevant to both human and planetary health.

Aspects of global change, including CO2 enrichment, climate change, land use alteration, and shifts in aboveground biodiversity all have the potential to affect soil biodiversity, as well as the ecosystem-level processes that they regulate. While there is a growing body of scientific literature recognising and addressing community and ecosystem response to multiple, interacting elements of global change, soil biodiversity and soil systems are still relatively underrepresented in this literature. Yet, at the same time, soils play a major role in global carbon budgets, and therefore hold the key to understanding future climate scenarios. This special issue highlighted the current knowledge of how soil biodiversity responds to pertinent global change factors, and the ecosystem-level consequences of those changes.

Pilot fatigue can affect their performance and has become a threat to flight safety. Objective: This study examines whether different flight time limitations (FTL) and rosters of EASA-based and Australian pilots were associated with different levels of stress, sleep difficulties, fatigue levels, symptoms of depression or anxiety and wellbeing. Method: 192 EASA-based and 180 Australian pilots completed a cross-sectional online survey, which asked for their schedules, stress, sleep problems, fatigue, wellbeing, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. These variables were compared for the groups of EASA-based and Australian pilots. Findings: Although EASA based and Australian pilots were scheduled for only 57–62% of maximum duty and flight hours, 71.8% EASA-based vs. 77% Australian pilots reported severe or high fatigue. Significant depression symptoms were reported by 17.2% Australian and 18% EASA-based pilots, 7% pilots reported significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Australian pilots reported more demanding rosters, significantly more sleep problems and significantly lower wellbeing. Conclusions: Present regulations and FTL likely could not prevent high fatigue levels among EASA based and Australian pilots. Both groups were equally fatigued, although Australian pilots reported more demanding rosters. Pilots of both groups reported the same levels of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms, while Australian pilots’ sleep and wellbeing were significantly more impaired. These results suggest that fatigue should not be regarded as an isolated problem for flight-safety.

Mental health was assessed on the PHQ-2 (depression) and GAD-7 (generalized anxiety disorder) scales. The findings indicated that first-generation adolescents from immigrant families were significantly more likely than their second-generation counterparts to report mental-health symptoms, and they also provided worse scores on all measures examined. It was alarming that 42 per cent of the first-generation immigrant group reported that they could not discuss their personal worries with anyone, and more than one-fifth of these youth hardly ever talked about personal matters with their parents. Experienced discrimination was a slightly stronger predictor of generalized anxiety than depressive symptoms and it predicted both symptoms of depression and anxiety more prominently among first-generation immigrant adolescents compared with their second-generation counterparts. Being able to discuss personal matters with parents functioned as a protective factor with similar predictor values in both groups, whereas the possibility of having someone with whom to discuss personal worries was significantly associated to lower levels of anxiety only among first-generation immigrant adolescents.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Yet, the activation of CO2 is challenging and energy-intensive and today the production of one oxalate molecule first requires the reduction of two CO2 molecules. Recently we confirmed the crucial role of the reactive carbonite intermediate in the FOCR. Due to its high reactivity, this intermediate might also be a strong enough nucleophile to react with CO2 directly. If this is the case, we can form oxalate directly from CO2 and formate and avoid the need for double electrochemical CO2 reduction in oxalate production. In this work, we successfully established the conversion of CO2 (with a theoretical yield of 52%) to oxalate (via the reaction with carbonite), as well as to formate and carbonate. The direct reaction of the reactive carbonite intermediate with CO2 was the dominant pathway for CO2 incorporation in oxalate. For enhancing the CO2 incorporation in oxalate, we found a reaction temperature of 200°C, stoichiometric amounts of the base, and the presence of CO2 in the supercritical state most suitable. The residence time is strongly depending on the reactor type but should be kept to a minimum to avoid carbonate formation. The presence of high amounts of hydride and supercritical CO2 appeared to also cause the formation of carbonates as a side-product. The carbonate formation increased with higher temperatures and longer reaction times, which suggests a consecutive decomposition of oxalate formed in the reaction.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer treated with ovarian suppression: a patient-level meta-analysis of 7030 women from four randomised trials,/articles/aromatase-inhibitors-versus-tamoxifen-premenopausal-women-oestrogen-receptor-positive-early,"This Article support SDGs 3 and 5, focusing on assessing outcomes in premenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer receiving ovarian suppression, in particular comparing tamoxifen versus aromatase inhibitors in this population. ",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 5: Gender equality,"Background: For women with early-stage oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, adjuvant tamoxifen reduces 15-year breast cancer mortality by a third. Aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women but are ineffective in premenopausal women when used without ovarian suppression. We aimed to investigate whether premenopausal women treated with ovarian suppression benefit from aromatase inhibitors. Methods: We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials comparing aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, exemestane, or letrozole) versus tamoxifen for 3 or 5 years in premenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer receiving ovarian suppression (goserelin or triptorelin) or ablation. We collected data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of any breast cancer recurrence or second primary cancer, and dates and causes of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence (distant, locoregional, or contralateral), breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. As distant recurrence invariably results in death from breast cancer several years after the occurrence, whereas locoregional recurrence and new contralateral breast cancer are not usually fatal, the distant recurrence analysis is shown separately. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses estimated first-event rate ratios (RR) and their confidence intervals (CIs). Findings: We obtained data from all four identified trials (ABCSG XII, SOFT, TEXT, and HOBOE trials), which included 7030 women with ER-positive tumours enrolled between June 17, 1999, and Aug 4, 2015. Median follow-up was 8·0 years (IQR 6·1–9·3). The rate of breast cancer recurrence was lower for women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor than for women assigned to tamoxifen (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·69–0·90, p=0·0005). The main benefit was seen in years 0–4 (RR 0·68, 99% CI 0·55–0·85; p<0·0001), the period when treatments differed, with a 3·2% (95% CI 1·8–4·5) absolute reduction in 5-year recurrence risk (6·9% vs 10·1%). There was no further benefit, or loss of benefit, in years 5–9 (RR 0·98, 99% CI 0·73–1·33, p=0·89) or beyond year 10. Distant recurrence was reduced with aromatase inhibitor (RR 0·83, 95% CI 0·71–0·97; p=0·018). No significant differences were observed between treatments for breast cancer mortality (RR 1·01, 95% CI 0·82–1·24; p=0·94), death without recurrence (1·30, 0·75–2·25; p=0·34), or all-cause mortality (1·04, 0·86–1·27; p=0·68). There were more bone fractures with aromatase inhibitor than with tamoxifen (227 [6·4%] of 3528 women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor vs 180 [5·1%] of 3502 women allocated to tamoxifen; RR 1·27 [95% CI 1·04–1·54]; p=0·017). Non-breast cancer deaths (30 [0·9%] vs 24 [0·7%]; 1·30 [0·75–2·25]; p=0·36) and endometrial cancer (seven [0·2%] vs 15 [0·3%]; 0·52 [0·22–1·23]; p=0·14) were rare. Interpretation: Using an aromatase inhibitor rather than tamoxifen in premenopausal women receiving ovarian suppression reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence.

Global and regional spending on dementia care from 2000–2019 and expected future health spending scenarios from 2020–2050: An economic modelling exercise,/articles/global-and-regional-spending-dementia-care-2000%E2%80%932019-and-expected-future-health-spending,"An article on global spending of dementia care, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on modelling global and regional estimates from 2000 to 2019 and expected future scenarios from 2020 to 2050.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The global burden of dementia is increasing. As diagnosis and treatment rates increase and populations grow and age, additional diagnosed cases will present a challenge to healthcare systems globally. Even modelled estimates of the current and future healthcare spending attributable to dementia are valuable for decision makers and advocates to prepare for growing demand. Methods: We modelled healthcare spending attributable to dementia from 2000 to 2019 and expected estimated future spending from 2020 to 2050 under multiple scenarios. Data were from the Global Burden of Diseases 2019 study and from two systematic literature reviews. We used meta-regression to estimate the fraction of dementia spending that is attributable to dementia for those receiving nursing home-based care and for those receiving community-based care. We used spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to account for data missingness and model diagnosis and treatment rates, nursing home-based care and community-based care rates, and unit costs for the many countries without their own underlying estimates. Projections of future spending estimate a baseline scenario from 2020 to 2050 based on ongoing growth. Alternative scenarios assessed faster growth rates for dementia diagnosis and treatment rates, nursing home-based care, and healthcare costs. All spending is reported in 2019 United States dollars or 2019 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars. Findings: Based on observed and modelled inputs, we estimated that global spending on dementia increased by 4.5% (95% uncertainty interval: 3.4–5.4%) annually from 2000 to 2019, reaching $263 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] $199– $333) attributable to dementia in 2019. We estimated total healthcare spending on patients with dementia was $594 billion (95% UI $457–$843). Under the baseline scenario, we estimated that attributable dementia spending will reach $1.6 trillion (95% UI $0.9–$2.6) by 2050. We project it will represent 11% (95% UI 6–18%) of all expected health spending, although it could be as high as 17% (95% UI 10–26%) under alternative scenarios. Interpretation: Health systems will experience increases in the burden of dementia in the near future. These modelled direct cost estimates, built from a relatively small set of data and linear time trends, highlight the magnitude of health system resources expected to be used to provide care and ensure sufficient and adequate resources for aging populations and their caretakers.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Dementia and depression are highly prevalent and comorbid conditions among older adults living in care homes and are associated with individual distress and rising societal costs. Effective, scalable, and feasible interventions are needed. Music interventions have shown promising effects, but the current evidence base is inconclusive. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of two different music interventions on the depressive symptoms of people with dementia living in residential aged care. Methods: We implemented a 2 × 2 factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial to determine whether group music therapy (GMT) is more effective than no GMT with standard care, or recreational choir singing (RCS) is more effective than no RCS with standard care, for reducing depressive symptoms and other secondary outcomes in people with dementia with mild to severe depressive symptoms living in residential aged care. Care home units with at least ten residents were allocated to GMT, RCS, GMT plus RCS, or standard care, using a computer-generated list with block randomisation (block size four). The protocolised interventions were delivered by music therapists (GMT) and community musicians (RCS). The primary outcome was Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months, assessed by a masked assessor and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects models, which examined the effects of GMT versus no-GMT and RCS versus no-RCS, as well as interaction effects of GMT and RCS. We report on the Australian cohort of an international trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03496675, and anzctr.org.au, ACTRN12618000156280. Findings: Between June 15, 2018, and Feb 18, 2020, we approached 12 RAC facilities with 26 eligible care home units and, excluding six units who could not be enrolled due to COVID-19 lockdowns, we screened 818 residents. Between July 18, 2018, and Nov 26, 2019, 20 care home units were randomised (318 residents). Recruitment ceased on March 17, 2020, due to COVID-19. The primary endpoint, available from 20 care home units (214 residents), suggested beneficial effects of RCS (mean difference –4·25, 95% CI –7·89 to –0·62; p=0·0221) but not GMT (mean difference –0·44, –4·32 to 3·43; p=0·8224).

While an increasing number of creative strategies are available to support people with dementia, the area of board games design and their effect on wellbeing is underexplored. This paper reports on the evaluation of the This is Me (TIM) mindful life-storytelling board game by the European project MinD. Using a co-design methodology, TIM was developed with and for people with mild to moderate dementia to support their wellbeing by enhancing self-empowerment and social engagement. A focus group methodology was used to evaluate TIM with 50 people with dementia and 19 carers across four countries. TIM was evaluated with regard to the usability and experience of the design as well as people's emotional wellbeing, social engagement and agency. The thematic analysis demonstrated that the combination of life-storytelling and mindfulness allowed players to engage in meaningful social interaction and, as a result, they reported enjoyment, learning, more acceptance of the past and present situation, and that they perceived looking forward into the future together with others as helpful. The study demonstrates that design can be a useful means to support people with dementia in aspects of emotional wellbeing, social engagement and a sense of agency.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Objective: This study aimed to characterize the prevalence of maternal mental health condition diagnoses and associated risk during delivery hospitalizations in the United States. Study Design: The 2000 to 2018 National Inpatient Sample was used for this repeated cross-sectional analysis. Delivery hospitalizations of women aged 15 to 54 years with and without mental health condition diagnoses, including depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorder, were identified. Temporal trends in mental health condition diagnoses during delivery hospitalizations were determined using the National Cancer Institute's Joinpoint Regression Program to estimate the average annual percent change with 95% confidence intervals. The trends in chronic conditions associated with mental health condition diagnoses, including asthma, pregestational diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, obesity, and substance use, were analyzed. The association between mental health conditions and the following adverse outcomes was determined: (1) severe maternal morbidity, (2) preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, (3) preterm delivery, (4) postpartum hemorrhage, (5) cesarean delivery, and (6) maternal mortality. Regression models for each outcome were performed with unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios as measures of effects. Results: Of 73,109,791 delivery hospitalizations, 2,316,963 (3.2%) had ≥1 associated mental health condition diagnosis. The proportion of delivery hospitalizations with a mental health condition increased from 0.6% in 2000 to 7.3% in 2018 (average annual percent change, 11.4%; 95% confidence interval, 10.3%–12.6%). Among deliveries in women with a mental health condition diagnosis, chronic health conditions, including asthma, pregestational diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, obesity, and substance use, increased from 14.9% in 2000 to 38.5% in 2018. Deliveries to women with a mental health condition diagnosis were associated with severe maternal morbidity (risk ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.86–1.90), preeclampsia and gestational hypertension (risk ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.58–1.60), preterm delivery (risk ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.35–1.36), postpartum hemorrhage (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.38), cesarean delivery (risk ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.20), and maternal death (risk ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–1.56). The increased risk was retained in adjusted models. Conclusion: The proportion of delivery hospitalizations with mental health condition diagnoses increased significantly throughout the study period. Mental health condition diagnoses were associated with other underlying chronic health conditions and a modestly increased risk of a range of adverse outcomes. The findings suggested that mental health conditions are an important risk factor in adverse maternal outcomes.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Identifying health conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease up to 15 years before diagnosis: an agnostic study of French and British health records,/articles/identifying-health-conditions-associated-alzheimers-disease-15-years-diagnosis-agnostic,"An article on Alzheimer's disease risk, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the association between health conditions diagnosed in primary care and incident Alzheimer's disease.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The identification of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease is paramount for early prevention and the targeting of new interventions. We aimed to assess the associations between health conditions diagnosed in primary care and the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease over time, up to 15 years before a first Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Methods: In this agnostic study of French and British health records, data from 20 214 patients with Alzheimer's disease in the UK and 19 458 patients with Alzheimer's disease in France were extracted from The Health Improvement Network database. We considered data recorded from Jan 1, 1996, to March 31, 2020 in the UK and from Jan 4, 1998, to Feb 20, 2019, in France. For each Alzheimer's disease case, a control was randomly assigned after matching for sex and age at last visit. We agnostically tested the associations between 123 different diagnoses of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, extracted from health records, and Alzheimer's disease, by running a conditional logistic regression to account for matching of cases and controls. We focused on three time periods before diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, to separate risk factors from early symptoms and comorbidities. Findings: Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the association between Alzheimer's disease and various health conditions were estimated, and p values were corrected for multiple comparisons. In both the British and French studies, ten health conditions were significantly positively associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk, in a window of exposure from 2–10 years before Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, comprising major depressive disorder (UK OR 1·34, 95% CI 1·23–1·46; France OR 1·73, 1·57–1·91), anxiety (UK OR 1·36, 1·25–1·47; France OR 1·50, 1·36–1·65), reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders (UK OR 1·40, 1·24–1·59; France OR 1·83, 1·55–2·15), hearing loss (UK OR 1·19, 1·11–1·28; France OR 1·51, 1·21–1·89), constipation (UK OR 1·31, 1·22–1·41; France OR 1·59, 1·44–1·75), spondylosis (UK OR 1·26, 1·14–1·39; France OR 1·62, 1·44–1·81), abnormal weight loss (UK OR 1·47, 1·33–1·63; France OR 1·88, 1·56–2·26), malaise and fatigue (UK OR 1·23, 1·14–1·32; France OR 1·59, 1·46–1·73), memory loss (UK OR 7·63, 6·65–8·76; France OR 4·41, 3·07–6·34), and syncope and collapse (UK OR 1·23, 1·10–1·37; France OR 1·57, 1·26–1·96). Depression was the first comorbid condition associated with Alzheimer's disease, appearing at least 9 years before the first clinical diagnosis, followed by anxiety, constipation, and abnormal weight loss. Interpretation: These results from two independent primary care databases provide new evidence on the temporality of risk factors and early signs of Alzheimer's disease that are observable at the general practitioner level. These results could guide the implementation of new primary and secondary prevention policies.

Outdoor air pollution exposure and cognitive performance: findings from the enrolment phase of the CONSTANCES cohort,/articles/outdoor-air-pollution-exposure-and-cognitive-performance-findings-enrolment-phase,"An article on air pollution and cognitive decline, in the context of SDGs 3 and 11, focusing specifically on the association between exposure to outdoor air pollutants and cognitive performance.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities,"Background: Air pollution exposure is one of the modifiable risk factors of cognitive decline. We aimed to test the association between exposure to several outdoor air pollutants and domain-specific cognitive performance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we used data from the enrolment phase of the French CONSTANCES cohort. From the 220 000 people (aged 18–69 years) randomly recruited in the French CONSTANCES cohort, participants aged 45 years old or older (104 733 people) underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment (verbal episodic memory, language skills, and executive functions). After exclusion of those who were not suitable for our analysis, 61 462 participants with available data were included in the analyses. We used annual mean concentrations at residential addresses, derived from land-use regression models, to assign exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and black carbon. We used multiple linear regression models with different covariate adjustments to test the associations between each pollutant and cognitive outcomes. We did several sensitivity analyses, including multilevel modelling, meta-analysis by centre of recruitment, and exclusion of specific population groups. Findings: We found significantly poorer cognitive function, especially on semantic fluency and domains of executive functions, with an increase in exposure to black carbon and NO2. Exposure to PM2·5 was mainly significant for the semantic fluency test. We found that decrease in cognitive performance with an increase of one interquartile range of exposure ranged from 1% to nearly 5%. The largest effect size (percentage decrease) for both PM2.5 and NO2 was found for the semantic fluency test (PM2.5 4·6%, 95% CI 2·1–6·9 and NO2 3·8%, 1·9–5·7), whereas for black carbon, the largest effect size was found for the digit symbol substitution test of the domains of executive functions (4·5%, 2·7–6·3). Monotonic and linear exposure–response associations were found between air pollution exposure and cognitive performance, starting from a low level of exposures. Interpretation: Significantly poorer cognitive performance was associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution even at low levels of exposure. This highlights the importance of further efforts to reduce exposure to air pollution.

Dementia care-sharing and migration: An intersectional exploration of family carers' experiences,/articles/dementia-care-sharing-and-migration-intersectional-exploration-family-carers-experiences,"This article addresses ways to share the burden of care for those with dementia.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background and objectives: Previous studies show that persons with a migration background (PwM) caring for a family member with dementia often experience access barriers to formal care services, and that family carers often perform the lion's share of care. Yet research offering a detailed account on their experiences of dementia care-sharing is sparse. In this paper, we respond to this knowledge gap by exploring how different social categories impact on practices of care-sharing in our participants and their families. Research design and methods: A qualitative study of six PwM who provide care for a family member with dementia was conducted through two methods: semi-structured, life-story interviews followed by “shadowing” our participants in their daily lives. We were guided by intersectionality as an analytical lens in exploring the multifaceted experiences of care-sharing. Findings: Throughout our analysis, intersections of migration history and social class stood out the most. We elucidate how they influence the attainment of necessary skills to organize and share care-tasks as well as perceptions of “good care.” Additionally, our findings illustrate how one's position within the family, the presence or absence of supportive social networks, religion, gendered care norms, and relationship to the care-recipient are relevant to experiences of care-sharing. Implications: Rather than overemphasizing ethnicity and culture, practice and policy should take into account that intersections of various social categories affect care-sharing and the type of support that is (or is not) organized.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At least 10 countries linked current impacts on aquaculture to climate change. Global papers cited technology for adaption, while regional papers cited governance.
",Goal 14: Life below water; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 13: Climate action,"Food production is one of the main contributors to climate change, but is also vulnerable to the resulting stressors, which is well documented for agriculture and fisheries. Attention is now turning to the rapidly growing aquaculture sector and its vulnerability to a changing climate. Here we explore the extent to which climate stressors and aquaculture, and concomitant adaptation strategies, are studied in science and addressed in public media (news) to assess focus and attribution of climate change. We reviewed 553 scientific publications and 228 news media articles on climate stressors, impacts, and adaptation approaches with respect to aquaculture. Results indicate that coverage in the scientific community of climate stressors on aquaculture have not kept pace with growth of production in the sector, especially compared to agriculture and fisheries. Temperature, sea level rise, and ocean acidification were most often the focus in science (44%) and news (42%), suggesting some alignment. Combined coverage tended to revolve around Asia, Europe, and North/Central America (70%) and at least 10 countries' science and news linked current impacts on aquaculture to climate change. The majority of scientific articles addressing adaptation were regional rather than global, and emphasized governance and institutional strategies over technological solutions. In all, this research highlights the comparatively nascent focus of climate change implications for aquaculture, narrow emphasis of stressors, but fairly representative coverage of regions with more aquaculture. Our work highlights the need for more research and public awareness of the social and ecological climate change threats and impacts on, and adaptive strategies for aquaculture.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
Role of climate goals and clean-air policies on reducing future air pollution deaths in China: a modelling study,/articles/role-climate-goals-and-clean-air-policies-reducing-future-air-pollution-deaths-china,"An Article in support of SDGs 3, 7, and 13, showing that adopting strict climate policies (the 1·5°C and 2°C targets) and strengthening clean-air policies could achieve major improvements in air quality and substantially reduce the human health effects from air pollution in China.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background: Over 3 million people die every year from diseases caused by exposure to outdoor PM2·5 air pollution, and more than a quarter of these premature deaths occur in China. In addition to clean-air policies that target pollution emissions, climate policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel CO2 emissions (eg, to avoid 1·5°C of warming) might also greatly improve air quality and public health. However, no comprehensive accounting of public health outcomes has been done under different energy pathways and local clean-air management decisions in China. We aimed to develop an integrated method for quantifying the health co-benefits from different climate, energy, and clean-air policy scenarios and to assess the relationship between climate and clean-air policies and future health burdens in China, where an ageing population will further exacerbate the effects of air pollution. Methods: For this modelling study, we used a China-focused integrated assessment model and a dynamic emission projection model to project future Chinese air quality in scenarios spanning a range of global climate targets (1·5°C, 2°C, national determined contributions [NDC], unambitious, baseline, and 4·5°C) and national clean-air actions (termed 2015-pollution, current-pollution, and ambitious-pollution). We then evaluated the health effects of PM2·5 air pollution in the scenario matrix using the air quality model and the latest epidemiological concentration–response functions from the 2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. Findings: We found that, without ambitious climate mitigation (eg, under current NDC pledge), Chinese deaths related to PM2·5 air pollution might not always decrease—and might often grow—by 2050 compared with the base year of 2015, regardless of clean-air policies and air quality improvements. For example, in the scenario that tracks China's current NDC pledge and uses the best available pollution control technologies (the ambitious-pollution and NDC goals scenario), PM2·5-related deaths in China would decrease slightly by 2030 to 1·23 million per year (95% CI 0·95–1·51) from 1·25 million (1·04–1·46) in 2015, but would not decrease further by 2050 (1·21 million, 0·86–1·60) despite substantial and continuous improvements in population-weighted air quality (from 27·2 μg/m3 in 2030 to 16·0 μg/m3 in 2050). The contrary trends of improving air quality and increasing PM2·5-related deaths in many of our scenarios revealed the extent to which extra efforts are needed to compensate for the increasing age of China's population in the future. With the scenarios that included ambitious clean-air policies and met international climate goals to avoid 1·5°C and 2°C of warming (the ambitious-pollution-2°C goals scenario and the ambitious-pollution-1·5°C goals scenario), we observed substantial decreases in China's PM2·5-related deaths of 0·32–0·55 million deaths compared with NDC goals in 2050, and age-standardised death rates decreased by 10·2–14·2 deaths per 100 000 population per year. Interpretation: Our results show that ambitious climate policies (ie, limiting global average temperature rise to well below 2°C) and low-carbon energy transitions coupled with stringent clean-air policies are necessary to substantially reduce the human health effects from air pollution in China, regardless of socioeconomic assumptions. Our findings could help policy makers understand the crucial links between climate policy and public health.

The research also identifies common barriers cities face that prevent the implementation of co-benefit approaches. Finally, drawing on approaches taken by the cities that comprehensively plan for adaptation-mitigation co-benefits, three actions are outlined to serve as recommendations for cities to help catalyse the uptake of co-benefits and avoid trade-offs in adaptation planning. Delivering mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions was a strategic aim of five of eight cities. Four of these cities comprehensively identified mitigation co-benefits of planned adaptation measures. Certain types of co-benefits were more commonly utilised by cities, such as ecosystem-based strategies and building design measures. The alignment of adaptation and development goals is a more common aim than the alignment of adaptation and mitigation.

However, policy measures for reaching climate targets should avoid increasing unequal mobility chances. Therefore, there is a need for concepts striving to mitigate both climate impacts and transport injustice. The paper addresses the potential of introducing individual mobility budgets to achieve transport-related climate goals while reducing inequalities in mobility.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"BACKGROUND: Maternal and neonatal mortality rates remain high in many economically underdeveloped countries, including Nepal, and good quality antenatal care can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, identifying how to best improve antenatal care can be challenging. OBJECTIVE: To identify the interventions that have been investigated in the antenatal period in Nepal for maternal or neonatal benefit. We wanted to understand their scale, location, cost, and effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN: Online bibliographic databases (Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, British Nursing Index, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine) and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched from their inception till May 24, 2020. We included all studies reporting any maternal or neonatal outcome after an intervention in the antenatal period. We screened the studies and extracted the data in duplicate. A meta-analysis was not possible because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes, so we performed a narrative synthesis of the included studies. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies showed a variety of approaches toward improving antenatal care (eg, educational programs, incentive schemes, micronutrient supplementation) in different settings (home, community, or hospital-based) and with a wide variety of outcomes. Less than a quarter of the studies were randomized controlled trials, and many were single-site or reported only short-term outcomes. All studies reported having made a positive impact on antenatal care in some way, but only 3 provided a cost-benefit analysis to support implementation. None of these studies focused on the most remote communities in Nepal. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review found good quality evidence that micronutrient supplementation and educational interventions can bring important clinical benefits.

However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding whether industrial emission reduction and water saving can be achieved simultaneously. Here, we adopt a general equilibrium model using a self-developed high-resolution provincial water-use inventory based on enterprise census data, to uncover the impacts achieving carbon neutrality would have on industrial water use across China. Meeting carbon neutrality enables the achievement of the TRL-associated industrial water-use target and can reduce industrial water use by 24% in 2060. Nevertheless, if inter-provincial industrial relocation occurs, water use could rise in certain provinces, reducing the above water-saving potential.

",Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"The well-documented and forced migration of Indigenous Peoples from ancestral lands has fragmented connections to, and understandings of place. Yet Indigenous Peoples are reconceptualizing and revitalizing these connections including by leading forest landscape restoration efforts. Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) supports the design and practice of ecological restoration across rural to urban gradients – including both ancestral lands and contemporary places, with thought leaders advocating for biocultural approaches to address biodiversity loss, land occupation, and the colonial legacies of social and economic marginalization of Indigenous Peoples. To date, there are few examples in Hawai‘i, where in 1893 the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom disenfranchised most Indigenous People of land, freshwater, and coastal resources. Here we describe the Pu‘uwa‘awa‘a Community-Based Subsistence Forest Area (P-CBSFA), that was formed in 2017 to steward 34-ha of land within the Pu‘uwa‘awa‘a State Forest Reserve, North Kona, Hawai‘i Island and is led by multi-generational lineal descendants of Pu‘uwa‘awa‘a. We focus on how this stewardship initiative has relied on holistic acknowledgement in the engagement of historical context, a Native Hawaiian conceptualization of the restoration process, and a collaborative and consensus-based restoration practice that includes non-profit organizations and state and federal agencies. This initiative, the first community-based and subsistence-focused forest restoration project on State of Hawaiʻi administered lands, is using a biocultural framework to transform 34-ha of non-native and fire-prone grasses into a native species dominated dryland subsistence forest. To do this, the P-CBSFA relies on a relationship ethic to: (i) build trust among partners; (ii) articulate an exportable vision of ILK-based restoration; (iii) walk in awareness of historical and contemporary injustices; (iv) enhance cultural values of the landscape; (v) establish and rely on formal, empathy focused communication; (vi) focus on community directed benefits; and most importantly (vii) cultivate joy. From this framework, the P-CBSFA emerges to provide a multi-dimensional passageway through which lineal descendants of Pu‘uwa‘awa‘a are formalizing governance and decision-making authority over their ancestral lands.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Disparities in Access to Radiation Therapy Facilities Among American Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanics in Washington State,/articles/disparities-access-radiation-therapy-facilities-among-american-indiansalaska-natives-and,"Looks at disparities in access to healthcare among Indigenous people.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Purpose: Racial and ethnic minorities in the state of Washington experience higher cancer mortality relative to whites. We sought to characterize differences in travel distance to radiation therapy (RT) facilities in Washington by race and ethnicity with a special focus on non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives as a contributor to limited access and cancer disparities. Methods and Materials: Geocoded mortality data from Washington Department of Health (2011-2018) were used to identify decedents with mortality related to all-causes, all cancers, and cancers likely requiring access to RT. This was determined from optimal RT usage estimates by diagnosis. RT facility locations were ascertained from the Directory of Radiation Therapy Centers and confirmed. Distance from decedents’ address listed on death certificates to nearest RT facility was calculated. Generalized mixed models were used for statistical analysis. Results: We identified 418,754 deaths; 109,134 were cancer-related, 60,973 likely required RT. Among decedents with cancers likely requiring RT, non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives decedents would have had to travel 1.16 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.24) farther from their residences to reach the nearest treatment facility compared with non-Hispanic whites. This association existed in metro counties but was more pronounced in nonmetro counties (1.39 times farther; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). In addition, Hispanics would have had to travel 1.11 times farther (95% CI, 1.06-1.16) to reach the nearest facility compared with non-Hispanic whites, primarily due to differences in urban counties. Decedents in nonmetro counties lived on average 35 miles (SD = 29) from RT centers and non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives in nonmetro counties 53 miles (SD = 38). Compared with non-Hispanic white decedents, those who were non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian decedents lived closer to RT facilities. Conclusions: We observed significant disparities in access to RT facilities in Washington, specifically for non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives and rural decedents. The findings call for initiatives to improve access to critical cancer treatment services for these underserved populations with known disparities in cancer deaths.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Land use and land cover changes in the Jedeb and Chemoga watersheds have been detected in the past 29 years. The study used ERDAS IMAGINE 2015 tools to classify landsat 5 TM, landsat satellite images for the preparation of the year 1990, 2000, 2009 and 2018 land use class maps through likelihood supervised classification techniques. The SWAT model has been used to determine the seasonal variability of streamflow and sediment yield due to land use and land cover changes in the watersheds. To calibrate and validate streamflow and sediment yields as well as to test SWAT model performance SWAT-CUP SUFI 2 algorithm was used. The outcome showed that 29 years generalized shift of 62.3% increase in farm land, 57.8% decrease in forest cover, 52.4% decrease in grass land, 64.2% decrease in shrub land, 145.2% increase in bare land and 46.5 percent increase in Jedeb watershed settlement. Similarly, the analysis showed that 47.3% increase in farm land, 81.8% decrease in forest cover, 148.9% increase in grass land, 89% decrease in shrub land, 10.7% increase in bare land and 96.9% decrease in Chemoga watershed water body. The average monthly flow of Jedeb watershed flows increased by 39.31 m3 / s from 1990 to 2009 and decreased by 17.19 m3 / s from 2009 to 2018. In Chemoga watershed average monthly streamflow increase between 1990 and 2009 in 36.73 m3 / s but decrease between 2009 and 2018 in 37.77 m3 / s. The average monthly Jedeb watershed sediment yield decreased by 204.59 ton / month from 1990 to 2000, increased by 15,962.76 ton / month from 2000 to 2009 and ultimately decreased by 9,012.83 ton / month from 2009 to 2018.

"The contribution of unstable housing to HIV and hepatitis C virus transmission among people who inject drugs globally, regionally, and at country level: a modelling study",/articles/contribution-unstable-housing-hiv-and-hepatitis-c-virus-transmission-among-people-who,"This Article supports SDG 3 by showing the association between unstable housing (the lack of access to adequate or fixed housing) with HIV and HCV infection among people who inject drugs, finding that a substantial proportion of infections (11.2% of new HCV infections in the study period) and suggesting that the broader social needs of this population, including housing, should be addressed as part of efforts to reduce and eliminate these infections.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: A considerable proportion of people who inject drugs are unstably housed. Although unstable housing is associated with HIV and HCV infection among people who inject drugs, its contribution to transmission is unknown. We estimated the global and national proportions of incident HIV and HCV infections among people who inject drugs attributed to housing instability from 2020 to 2029. Methods: In this modelling study, we developed country-level models of unstable housing and HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs in 58 countries globally, calibrated to country-specific data on the prevalences of HIV and HCV and unstable housing. Based on a recently published systematic review, unstably housed people who inject drugs were assumed to have a 39% (95% CI 6–84) increased risk of HIV transmission and a 64% (95% CI 43–89%) increased risk of HCV transmission. We used pooled country-level estimates from systematic reviews on HCV and HIV prevalence in people who inject drugs. Our models estimated the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF) of unstable housing to HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs, defined as the percentage of infections prevented from 2020 to 2029 if the additional risk due to unstable housing was removed. Findings: Our models were produced for 58 countries with sufficient data (accounting for >66% of the global people who inject drugs population). Globally, we project unstable housing contributes 7·9% (95% credibility interval [CrI] 2·3–15·7) of new HIV infections and 11·2% (7·7–15·5) of new HCV infections among people who inject drugs from 2020 to 2029. Country-level tPAFs were strongly associated with the prevalence of unstable housing. tPAFs were greater in high-income countries (HIV 17·2% [95% CrI 5·1–30·0]; HCV 19·4% [95% CrI 13·8–26·0]) than in low-income or middle-income countries (HIV 6·6% [95% CrI 1·8–13·1]; HCV 8·3% [95% CrI 5·5–11·7]). tPAFs for HIV and HCV were highest in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, India, USA, England, and Wales where unstable housing contributed more than 20% of new HIV and HCV infections. Interpretation: Unstable housing is an important modifiable risk factor for HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs in many countries. The study emphasises the importance of implementing initiatives to mitigate these risks and reduce housing instability.

We examined the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants in six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods: We analysed participants enrolled in the population-based HELIUS cohort, who were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answered COVID-19-related questions between June 24-October 9, 2020 (after the first wave) and November 23, 2020-March 31, 2021 (during the second wave). We modelled SARS-CoV-2 incidence from January 1, 2020-March 31, 2021 using Markov models adjusted for age and sex. We compared incidence between ethnic groups over time and identified determinants of incident infection within ethnic groups. Findings: 2,497 participants were tested after the first wave; 2,083 (83·4%) were tested during the second wave. Median age at first visit was 54 years (interquartile range=44–61); 56·6% were female. Compared to Dutch-origin participants (15·9%), cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence was higher in participants of South-Asian Surinamese (25·0%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=1·66; 95%CI=1·16–2·40), African Surinamese (28·9%, aHR=1·97; 95%CI=1·37–2·83), Turkish (37·0%; aHR=2·67; 95%CI=1·89–3·78), Moroccan (41·9%; aHR=3·13; 95%CI=2·22–4·42), and Ghanaian (64·6%; aHR=6·00; 95%CI=4·33–8·30) origin. Compared to those of Dutch origin, differences in incidence became wider during the second versus first wave for all ethnic minority groups (all p-values for interaction<0·05), except Ghanaians. Having household members with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, larger household size, and low health literacy were common determinants of SARS-CoV-2 incidence across groups.

Elevated levels of antibiotic resistance in groundwater during treated wastewater irrigation associated with infiltration and accumulation of antibiotic residues,/articles/elevated-levels-antibiotic-resistance-groundwater-during-treated-wastewater-irrigation,"This paper addresses pharmaceutical detection in groundwater.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Treated wastewater irrigation (TWW) releases antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into the environment and might thus promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in groundwater (GW). We hypothesized that TWW irrigation increases ARG abundance in GW through two potential mechanisms: the contamination of GW with resistant bacteria and the accumulation of antibiotics in GW. To test this, the GW below a real-scale TWW-irrigated field was sampled for six months. Sampling took place before, during and after high-intensity TWW irrigation. Samples were analysed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR of six ARGs and the class 1 integron-integrase gene intI1, while liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was performed to detect antibiotic and pharmaceutical residues. Absolute abundance of 16S rRNA in GW decreased rather than increased during long-term irrigation. Also, the relative abundance of TWW-related bacteria did not increase in GW during long-term irrigation. In contrast, long-term TWW irrigation increased the relative abundance of sul1 and intI1 in the GW microbiome. Furthermore, GW contained elevated concentrations of sulfonamide antibiotics, especially sulfamethoxazole, to which sul1 confers resistance. Total sulfonamide concentrations in GW correlated with sul1 relative abundance. Consequently, TWW irrigation promoted sul1 and intI1 dissemination in the GW microbiome, most likely due to the accumulation of drug residues.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Methods: We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial between Jan 30, 2018, and Feb 18, 2019, in 66 rural villages in Puri, Odisha, India. Villages were eligible if not adjacent to another included village and not designated by the Government to be open-defecation free. All latrine-owning households in selected villages were eligible.

How do sources of carbon dioxide emissions affect life expectancy? Insights from 68 developing and emerging economies,/articles/how-do-sources-carbon-dioxide-emissions-affect-life-expectancy-insights-68-developing-and,"This study investigates how the sources of carbon emissions affect life expectancy. The study sample includes 68 developing and emerging economies for the period 1990-2017. Disaggregated analysis is performed on: (1) emissions sources; (2) income groups. A negative nexus between life expectancy and CO2 emissions exists for emerging ones. However, CO2 emissions seem to improve the life expectancy for developing countries. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"This study is possibly the first to investigate the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on life expectancy for 68 low- and middle-income countries for the 1990–2017 period. The analysis was carried out on a disaggregated basis on two dimensions: (1) the sources of CO2 emissions (i.e., consumption-based or production-based CO2 emissions) and (2) the level of economic development (i.e., developing or emerging) of countries. The results support the evidence of a negative association between life expectancy and CO2 emissions for the whole sample as well as for the group of emerging countries. This finding occurred irrespective of whether the CO2 emissions were consumption-based or production-based, suggesting that both consumption and production may reduce the life expectancy of the people in these groups of economies through the generation of harmful pollutants. In contrast, CO2 emissions, regardless of their sources, seem to improve the life expectancy of those in the group of developing countries in our study sample.

Impact of gender and caregiving responsibilities on academic success in hematology,/articles/impact-gender-and-caregiving-responsibilities-academic-success-hematology,Research looking into the disparities between male and female researchers in hematology,Goal 5: Gender equality; Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"We previously identified gender disparities in academic success during evaluation of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Clinical Research Training Institute (CRTI) and hypothesized that it may be related to caregiving. The objective was to evaluate the impact of gender and caregiving responsibilities on academic success. A cross-sectional survey that included a question about caregiving responsibilities was distributed to alumni who participated in CRTI from 2003 to 2016 and asked about academic productivity in the previous 3 years. Publications and grants were abstracted from submitted curriculum vitae. Academic success was defined as number of first- or senior-author publications, total publications, grants, and percent effort in research. Of 280 potential respondents, 258 responded (92% response rate), 169 (66%) had caregiving responsibilities, and 110 (43%) were men. Respondents with caregiving responsibilities had fewer first- or senior-author publications (median, 3 vs 5; P = .003) and less percent effort in research (median, 40% vs 50%; P = .006). Men had more first- or senior-author publications (median, 4 vs 3; P = .002) and more total publications (median, 12 vs 6.5; P = .0002) than women. When stratified by those without (P = .0001) or with (P = .042) caregiving responsibilities, men had more publications than women. Among men, caregiving responsibilities significantly reduced all outcomes. However, among women, caregiving did not have an impact. In conclusion, men had more publications than women whether or not they had caregiving responsibilities. However, among men, caregiving reduced academic productivity whereas among women, caregiving did not have impact. The scientific community will need to continue to identify the reasons for disparities and implement changes to address them.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 13: Climate action,"Small island developing states face challenges in cultivating healthy food systems and are currently bearing substantial burdens of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Local food production—rooted in collective local and Indigenous traditions, self-sufficiency, and climate-adaptive agricultural practices—has long emphasised a fibre-rich, plant-based diet; however, common histories of dietary colonialism have replaced local, small-scale farming and fisheries with non-nutritive cash crops, intensive livestock operations, and high-quality food exportation. Along with declines in traditional food availability, the resulting food import dependence has fostered a diabetogenic ecosystem composed of energy-dense cereal products, animal-based fats, and processed foods. The destabilisation of local food sectors undermines small island social and cultural systems, contributes to impoverishment and food insecurity during natural disasters, and, ultimately, can reduce diet quality and increase type 2 diabetes risk. Despite ongoing marginalisation of traditional local food systems, locally produced foods such as starchy roots, legumes, fruits, and seafood persist as nutritious and ecologically relevant cornerstones of self-determined local economic productivity and dietary health. Findings from community and epidemiological work suggest that local food production—bolstered by local and Indigenous agroecological knowledge, cultural preservation, and collective agency—can aid in reclaiming healthy and climate-resilient small island food systems.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Therefore, agriculture is vital for food security and supports the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) 2 (SDG 2 - zero hunger) as others SDG's. Several studies have been published in different world areas with different research directions focused on increasing food and nutritional security from an agricultural land system perspective. The heterogeneity of the agricultural research studies calls for an interdisciplinary and comprehensive systematization of the different research directions and the plethora of approaches, scales of analysis, and reference data used. Thus, this work aims to systematically review the contributions of the different agricultural research studies by systematizing the main research fields and present a synthesis of the diversity and scope of research and knowledge. From an initial search of 1151 articles, 260 meet the criteria to be used in the review. Our analysis revealed that most articles were published between 2015 and 2019 (59%), and most of the case studies were carried out in Asia (36%) and Africa (20%). The number of studies carried out in the other continents was lower. In the last 30 years, most of the research was centred in six main research fields: land-use changes (28%), agricultural efficiency (27%), climate change (16%), farmer's motivation (12%), urban and peri-urban agriculture (11%), and land suitability (7%). Overall, the research fields identified are directly or indirectly linked to 11 of the 17 SDGs.

Methods: A total of 160 patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive usual care (UC), AT, MT, or combination therapy (CT) during perioperative periods. Pain intensity and anxiety scores were measured by visual analog scale. Interleukin (IL)-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: There was a significant group effect on pain, anxiety, and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, with the greatest improvement occurring in the CT group (P < .001). Compared with the UC group, the AT and MT groups had lower mean changes of pain intensity and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, and greater anxiety reduction (P < .001). However, the differences between the AT and MT groups did not reach significance (P > .05). Conclusion: In patients with breast cancer, perioperative CT achieves greater pain improvement and anxiety reduction and less marked increase in IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels.

While high achievers such as physicians have been known to exhibit imposter phenomenon, there is limited literature specific to radiologists. Our purpose was to (1) investigate imposter phenomenon in radiologists and assess correlation with burnout, and (2) pilot an intervention aimed at addressing imposter phenomenon through improvisational theater techniques. Methods: Part 1 - Clinical radiology faculty at a single large academic medical center completed an anonymous survey with questions related to demographics, burnout (derived from the validated Mini-Z assessment tool), and imposter phenomenon. Part 2 - A one-hour interactive workshop on imposter phenomenon was organized for the radiology department at the same institution. The workshop included the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS). A post-workshop survey rating was also performed. Results: Part 1 - Of 30 clinical radiology faculty who participated in the survey, 83% reported feelings of imposter phenomenon during their career. There was significant (p = 0.024) correlation between imposter phenomenon and burnout. Part 2 - Of 21 members of the Department of Radiology who completed the CIPS in the interactive workshop, 71% exhibited frequent or intense symptoms of imposter phenomenon. On the post-workshop survey asking participants to rate the workshop, the mean score was 4.4 and the mode score was 5 on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Conclusion: Imposter phenomenon affects radiologists and is correlated with burnout.

Associations between blood sex steroid concentrations and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in healthy older women in Australia: a prospective cohort substudy of the ASPREE trial,/articles/associations-between-blood-sex-steroid-concentrations-and-risk-major-adverse-cardiovascular,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 5, focusing on the association between testosterone concentrations and risk of major adverse cardiac events in older women.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 5: Gender equality,"Background: Blood testosterone concentrations in women decline during the reproductive years and reach a nadir in the seventh decade, after which concentrations increase and are restored to those of reproductive-aged women early in the eighth decade. We aimed to establish the association between the concentration of testosterone in the blood and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality in healthy older women. Methods: SHOW was a prospective cohort substudy of the longitudinal randomised ASPREE trial. Eligible participants were women aged at least 70 years from Australia with unimpaired cognition, no previous MACE, and a life expectancy of at least 5 years. Participants who were receiving hormonal or steroid therapy were ineligible for inclusion. We measured serum concentrations of sex steroids with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and of SHBG with immunoassay. We compared lower concentrations of sex hormones with higher concentrations using four quartiles. Primary endpoints were risk of MACE and all-cause mortality, the associations of which with sex steroid concentrations were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression that included age, body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, impaired renal function, and treatment allocation in the ASPREE trial (aspirin vs placebo). ASPREE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01038583. Findings: Of the 9180 women recruited to the ASPREE trial between March 10, 2010, and Dec 31 2014, 6358 participants provided sufficient biobank samples at baseline and 5535 were included in the final analysis. Median age at entry was 74·0 years (IQR 71·7–77·7). During a median 4·4 years of follow-up (24 553 person-years), 144 (2·6%) women had a first MACE (incidence 5·9 per 1000 person-years). During a median 4·6 years of follow-up (3·8–5·6), 200 women died (7·9 per 1000 person-years). In the fully adjusted models, higher concentrations of testosterone were associated with a lower incidence of MACE (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: hazard ratio 0·57 [95% CI 0·36–0·91]; p=0·02), as were higher concentrations of DHEA (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: 0·61 [0·38–0·97]; p=0·04). For oestrone, a lower risk of MACE was seen for concentrations in quartile 2 only, compared with quartile 1 (0·55 [0·33–0·92]; p=0·02). In fully adjusted models, no association was seen between SHBG and MACE, or between any hormone or SHBG and all-cause mortality. Interpretation: Blood concentrations of testosterone and DHEA above the lowest quartile in older women were associated with a reduced risk of a first-ever MACE. Given that the physiological effects of DHEA are mediated through its steroid metabolites, if the current findings were to be replicated, trials investigating testosterone therapy for the primary prevention of ischaemic cardiovascular disease events in older women would be warranted.

Occurrence of cyanobacteria in water used for food production: A review,/articles/occurrence-cyanobacteria-water-used-food-production-review,The paper supports SDG 6 and 3 by discussing toxins in water and the risk of using contaminated water to process food.,Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Cyanobacteria have been part of the human diet for thousands of years. Environmental conditions such as high pH, light, temperature, and nutrients favour cyanobacterial growth which results in algal bloom formations. Cyanobacteria blooms may be toxic or non-toxic. Thus, the consumption of edible cyanobacteria such as spirulina may reduce the risks of cataracts and age-related muscular degeneration. Sulphate polysaccharides within some cyanobacteria have been shown to exhibit antitumor, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral activity against certain viruses and bacteria. There are many ways in which humans may be exposed to cyanobacteria and their cyanotoxins, with the most common route being eating and drinking of contaminated food and water, respectively. The current paper reviews cyanotoxin effects produced by cyanobacteria particularly in water and food, and its potential implications for human health. We further examine the quality of water used during food processing and developing a theoretical framework on cyanobacteria contamination of food. Concentrations of microcystin have been reported in crops and grain in Brazil, New Zealand and China. Microcystin concentrations of 8.31, 0.78 and 22 μg/kg were detected in lettuce, rape (Brassicas) and rice, respectively.

Changes in paddy cropping system enhanced economic profit and ecological sustainability in central China,/articles/changes-paddy-cropping-system-enhanced-economic-profit-and-ecological-sustainability,"These results suggested that ratoon rice is a suitable cropping system to achieve the food security, economic and environmental goals.
",Goal 2: Zero hunger,"In China, the traditional early and late season double rice (DR) system is declining accompanied by the fast increase of two newly developed cropping systems: ratoon rice (RR) and rice–crawfish (RC). Three methodologies: economic analysis, emergy evaluation and life cycle assessment (LCA) were employed to evaluate the economics and sustainability of this paddy cropping system change. Economic analysis indicated that the income and profit of the RC system were far larger than those of RR and DR. The income to costs ratio of RR and RC increased by 25.5 and 122.7% compared with that of DR, respectively. RC had the highest emergy input thanks to increasing irrigation water, electricity, juvenile crawfish and forage input while RR showed a lower total emergy and nonrenewable emergy input, such as irrigation water, electricity, fertilizers and pesticides than DR. The environmental loading ratios decreased by 16.7–50.4% when cropping system changed from DR to RR or from DR to RC while the emergy sustainability indexes increased by 22.6–112.9%. The life cycle assessment indicated lower potential environmental impacts of RR and RC, whose total environmental impact indexes were 35.0–61.0% lower than that of DR. Grain yield of RR was comparable with that of DR in spite of less financial and emergy input of RR, but RC had a much lower grain yield (a 53.6% reduction compared to DR).

Estimation of the global prevalence of dementia in 2019 and forecasted prevalence in 2050: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,/articles/estimation-global-prevalence-dementia-2019-and-forecasted-prevalence-2050-analysis-global,"An article on the global prevalence of dementia, in the context of SGD 3, focusing specifically on forecasting country-level estimates of dementia prevalence attributable to high BMI, high fasting glucose, and smoking, from 2019 to 2050.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Given the projected trends in population ageing and population growth, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase. In addition, strong evidence has emerged supporting the importance of potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Characterising the distribution and magnitude of anticipated growth is crucial for public health planning and resource prioritisation. This study aimed to improve on previous forecasts of dementia prevalence by producing country-level estimates and incorporating information on selected risk factors. Methods: We forecasted the prevalence of dementia attributable to the three dementia risk factors included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 (high body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and smoking) from 2019 to 2050, using relative risks and forecasted risk factor prevalence to predict GBD risk-attributable prevalence in 2050 globally and by world region and country. Using linear regression models with education included as an additional predictor, we then forecasted the prevalence of dementia not attributable to GBD risks. To assess the relative contribution of future trends in GBD risk factors, education, population growth, and population ageing, we did a decomposition analysis. Findings: We estimated that the number of people with dementia would increase from 57·4 (95% uncertainty interval 50·4–65·1) million cases globally in 2019 to 152·8 (130·8–175·9) million cases in 2050. Despite large increases in the projected number of people living with dementia, age-standardised both-sex prevalence remained stable between 2019 and 2050 (global percentage change of 0·1% [–7·5 to 10·8]). We estimated that there were more women with dementia than men with dementia globally in 2019 (female-to-male ratio of 1·69 [1·64–1·73]), and we expect this pattern to continue to 2050 (female-to-male ratio of 1·67 [1·52–1·85]). There was geographical heterogeneity in the projected increases across countries and regions, with the smallest percentage changes in the number of projected dementia cases in high-income Asia Pacific (53% [41–67]) and western Europe (74% [58–90]), and the largest in north Africa and the Middle East (367% [329–403]) and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (357% [323–395]). Projected increases in cases could largely be attributed to population growth and population ageing, although their relative importance varied by world region, with population growth contributing most to the increases in sub-Saharan Africa and population ageing contributing most to the increases in east Asia. Interpretation: Growth in the number of individuals living with dementia underscores the need for public health planning efforts and policy to address the needs of this group. Country-level estimates can be used to inform national planning efforts and decisions. Multifaceted approaches, including scaling up interventions to address modifiable risk factors and investing in research on biological mechanisms, will be key in addressing the expected increases in the number of individuals affected by dementia.

","Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure","Background: Black women are 40% more likely to die of breast cancer compared to White women. Inadequate representation of Black patients in clinical trials may contribute to health care inequity. We aimed to assess breast cancer clinical outcomes in Non-Hispanic Black (Black) versus Non-Hispanic White (White) women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) enrolled on investigator-initiated clinical trials at Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University, given the significant number of patients from underrepresented minority groups seen at Winship. Materials and Methods: Black and White women with MBC on investigator-initiated trials at Emory between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess clinical response and treatment toxicities. Differences in overall survival between groups was assessed using quantile analysis. Results: Sixty-two women with MBC were included (66% White vs. 34% Black). Black patients had less clinical benefit from the trial therapy as only 57% had partial response or stable disease as best response compared to 78% of White women (P = .09). Quantile analysis showed significant difference in mean survival between Whites and Blacks by the end of follow up (64 vs. 38 months). There were no significant differences in toxicities between groups. Conclusion: Participation rates of Black women with MBC on investigator-initiated clinical trials at an urban cancer center were higher compared to key national trials. Black women had worse treatment response and survival.

Results:There were substantial racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in patients with colorectal cancer, in receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and in receiving antihypertensive and antidiabetic treatment. Racial disparities in receiving these therapies remained significant in this large cohort of Medicare beneficiaries after stratifications by private health insurance status at the time of cancer diagnosis and by tumor stage. Non-Hispanic black patients had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04–1.10), which remained significantly higher (1.05, 1.02–1.08) after adjusting for patient sociodemographics, tumor factors, comorbidity and treatments as compared to non-Hispanic white patients. The adjusted risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality was also significantly higher (1.08, 1.04–1.12) between black and white patients. Conclusions:There were substantial racial disparities in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in men and women diagnosed with colorectal cancer and in receipt of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, antihypertensive and antidiabetic treatment.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 13: Climate action,"Climate change is directly and disproportionately threatening the right to health of people with disabilities due to higher ambient temperatures, elevated air pollutants, and increasing exposure to extreme weather events that include heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. Strikingly, the global mortality rate of people with disabilities in natural disasters is up to four times higher than people without disabilities due to a scarcity of inclusive planning, accessible information, early warning systems, transportation, and discriminatory attitudes within institutions and among individuals.1 Disasters also disrupt access to health-care services, medications, oxygen, haemodialysis, personal care assistance, and medical devices. Heat extremes are linked with elevated emergency room visits, hospital admittance, and mortality for individuals with mental health, cardiorespiratory, and other disabilities; pre-existing psychosocial disabilities triples the risk of death during heatwaves.2 High ambient temperatures also negatively affect the health of individuals whose disabilities are affected by temperature sensitivity or thermoregulation, including multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries. Likewise, numerous medications, including diuretics and antidepressants, can affect the thermoregulation of people with mental and physical disabilities.3 More broadly, climate change increases the risk of undernutrition, water insecurity, stress-related psychiatric disorders, and alters the geographical distribution of infectious diseases.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This study aimed to seek the prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, and liver damage among low-income patients attending a public tertiary care hospital in West Mexico. Methods: A retrospective/cross-sectional study at the Department of Genomic Medicine in Hepatology was conducted between March 1, 2016 to March 30, 2017. A total of 10,352 patients tested for anti-HCV, HBsAg, or anti-HIV (n=23,074) were included. Age, gender, and hospital service were registered. Liver fibrosis was assessed using APRI and FIB-4 scores. Results: Overall, 3.9% were anti-HCV+ (305/7848), 1.0% were HBsAg+ (80/7894), and 2.9% were anti-HIV+ (210/7332). A 43.8% (750/1959) of patients negative for all viruses had either abnormal AST, ALT, or GGT (≥40 UI/L). Also, significant liver fibrosis (APRI ≥ 0.7) was prevalent in 10.6% (191/1804). In patients who tested positive for viral infections, liver fibrosis was detected in 20.4% (11/54) of HBsAg+, 34.2% (53/155) in anti-HCV+ and 15.5% (16/103) in anti-HIV+. Anti-HCV+ was highest in Geriatrics (11.1%), HBsAg+ in HIV patients (3.0%) and anti-HIV+ in Emergency room attendees (33.3%). Conclusion: High seroprevalence of HCV, HBV, and HIV infections was found among the studied population. Significant liver fibrosis was detected in negative and positive patients for viral infections.

The performance gaps were due to technical, human, and economic factors.
",Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"Sustainability certifications like BREEAM, LEED, and China's sustainable green building award certification scheme encourage installation of technologies that save mains water and grid electricity. Among these are rainwater harvesting systems, ultralow water use appliances, photovoltaic panel systems, and intelligent building management systems. In reviewing the performance of two award-winning university buildings over respective periods of sixteen and four years, we found that such systems delivered only 28–71% of their potential resource savings. These performance gaps arose from various technical and social issues (pump failures, tank leakages, poor alignment of demand and supply with limited storage, low photovoltaic panel efficiency, poor user acceptance, etc.), but the consequences were exacerbated by inadequate asset management that resulted in long system downtimes, in some cases for 2–5 years. Repair, maintenance, and upgrading expenses then combined with lower than anticipated water and electricity bill savings that ultimately meant that, for the most part, there was no prospect of earning a return on capital expenditures. Continuous monitoring of building water consumption by an external service provider was the most effective resource and cost saving solution in this study, as it required no capital expenditure, and revealed a 1640 l/h leakage, without putting high demands on the building management. In contrast, little value was obtained from 25 water-related sensors installed as part of a “building-as-a-lab” project because of inadequate post hand-over support.

The authors identify and map types of harms or injustices experienced in the digital space to understand how they are translated into rights violations by adjudicative bodies. Racial structural injustice is one aspect of the research.","Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions","This study aims to map digitally mediated injustice and to understand how judicial versus non-judicial bodies contextualize and translate such harm into human rights violations. This study surveys judicial and quasi-judicial cases and case reports by non-judicial bodies, mainly civil society organizations, international organizations, and media. It divides digitally mediated harms identified through the survey into three categories: direct, structural, and hybrid harm. It then examines how these three forms of harm are represented and articulated in judicial judgments and case reports. To differentiate between the three forms of digitally mediated harm, the study uses Iris Young's political philosophy of structural injustice and Johan Galtung's account of structural violence in peace studies. The focus of this study is understanding the forms of injustices that are present but rendered invisible because of how they are contextualized. Therefore, the epistemology of absence is applied as the theoretical approach, that is, interpretation of absence and invisibility. The epistemology of absence facilitates the identification of structural and intersectional injustices that are not articulated in the same way they are experienced in society. The assessment reveals four observations. (1) Structural injustice is rarely examined through a conventional adjudicatory process. (2) Harms of structural quality examined by courts are narrowly interpreted when translated into rights violations. (3) The right to privacy, often presented as a gateway right, addresses structural injustice only partially, as this right has a subject-centric narrow interpretation currently. (4) There are limitations to the mainstream way of seeing and representing risks and injustices in the digital space, and such a view yields metonymic reasoning when framing digitally produced harms. As a result, the conventional way of contextualization is blind to unconventional experiences of vulnerability, which renders structural and intersectional injustices experienced by marginalized communities invisible.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Past research highlights the role social networks play as both a key outcome of participation, as well as an important step towards other environmental governance goals. This paper focuses on the social relation of mutual understanding, which is often discussed in the environmental governance literature, but has yet to be studied as an empirical social network in its own right. Our paper builds and tests a conceptual framework linking participation to mutual understanding and social learning. We analyze three waves of network and perceptions data gathered on stakeholders participating in the Integrated Coastal Resiliency Assessment (ICRA) project, a 2.5 year-long project aimed at developing a collaborative research assessment on the vulnerabilities to climate change experienced by an island community located in the Chesapeake Bay, USA. Our findings suggest that participation (measured as co-attendance in project events) leads to the formation of mutual understanding ties among stakeholders, but these ties do not necessarily lead to more similarity in stakeholders’ perceptions on climate change. We reflect on these findings, and the project more broadly, noting that our study lends support to scholars arguing that feelings of mutual understanding are potentially more important for certain forms of collective action, as opposed to whether or not stakeholders increase their shared beliefs or perceptions about the environmental problem in question.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Universal testing and treatment for HIV has shown promise as an approach to reduce mortality and lower HIV incidence. Evidence on the economic effects of this approach on individuals and households in low-resource settings is scarce. We aimed to examine the effect of universal HIV testing and treatment on a range of economic outcomes. Methods: We collected data in household surveys done over a 3-year period in a sample of HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults participating in a cluster-randomised trial of universal HIV testing and treatment in 32 rural communities in Kenya and Uganda. Communities of approximately 10 000 people were pair-matched on the basis of geographical and population characteristics, with the best-matching 16 pairs randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups. Participants in intervention communities received annual HIV and multidisease testing, universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility, and patient-centred care. Participants in control communities received baseline testing and medical care according to national guidelines. We analysed employment and health-care utilisation outcomes for working-age adults (age 18–65 years) and education outcomes for school-age children (6–17 years) using data from 3 years after the intervention. This trial is now complete, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01864603. Findings: Between July 9, 2013, and June 15, 2017, we collected survey data on 8198 working-age adults and 6755 school-age children. Compared with adults living with HIV in control communities, adults living with HIV in intervention communities were more likely to be employed (difference 9·7% [95% CI 2·1 to 18·3]), less likely to seek health care (–10·3% [–22·0 to 0·1]), and less likely to spend money on health care (–12·7% [–22·4 to 0·6]) 3 years after the intervention. We found no significant differences in outcomes between HIV-negative adults in intervention and control communities. Among children in households with HIV-positive adults, the intervention led to a 7·3% (95% CI 1·0 to 15·1) increase in primary school completion after 3 years in intervention communities compared with control communities. Interpretation: Universal HIV testing and treatment improved employment outcomes and other indicators of socioeconomic wellbeing for HIV-positive adults and children in their households, but had no effect on HIV-negative adults. Our findings suggest that the considerable investments needed to expand ART access might have substantial short-term and long-term economic returns.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Ethnic disparities in maternal mortality were first documented in the UK in the early 2000s but are known to be widening. This project aimed to describe the women who died in the UK during or up to a year after the end of pregnancy, to compare the quality of care received by women from different aggregated ethnic groups, and to identify any structural or cultural biases or discrimination affecting their care. Methods: National surveillance data was used to identify all 1894 women who died during or up to a year after the end of pregnancy between 2009 and 18 in the UK. Their characteristics and causes of death were described. A Confidential Enquiry was undertaken to describe the quality of care women received. The care of a stratified random sample of 54 women who died during or up to a year after the end of pregnancy between 2009 and 18, (18 from the aggregated group of Black women, 19 from the Asian aggregated group and 17 from the White aggregated group) was re-examined specifically to describe any structural or cultural biases or discrimination identified. Findings: There were no major differences causes of death between women from different aggregated ethnic groups, with cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death in all groups. Multiple areas of bias were identified in the care women received, including lack of nuanced care (notable amongst women from Black aggregated ethnic groups who died), microaggressions (most prominent in the care of women from Asian aggregated ethnic groups who died) and clinical, social and cultural complexity (evident across all ethnic groups).

For the population-based samples, we calculated the PCE-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk for 1272 eligible participants (378 women; median age 48 years [IQR 44–52]; 100% White) in the FHS third generation cohort and 550 participants (223 women [36·8% Black] and 327 men [40·4% Black]; median age 61 years [IQR 52–67]) in the NHANES cohort. The population-based samples showed similar risk differences to that of the in silico analyses. Interpretation: The PCE might generate substantially divergent cardiovascular disease risk estimates for Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles, which could introduce race-related variations in clinical recommendations for cardiovascular disease prevention.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities,"One of the most salient current engineering challenges facing sub-surface rail networks is overheating of stations during increasingly warm summer months. Reducing temperatures is a complex proposition in older networks like the London Underground (Tube): overheating poses important risks from both public health and engineering perspectives. Here we critically examine the use of two potential water sources – subterranean river flow and pumped groundwater from the Chalk aquifer – to supply pumped water-heat exchanger systems to cool the London Underground network. First, suitable localities were identified using GIS. Secondly, a proxy for subterranean rivers was used to compare methods of estimating discharge, which was then converted to cooling capacities over an annual hydrological cycle. Groundwater flow was simulated to determine the influence of pumping on the water table at two field sites. Finally, an economic and environmental analysis was undertaken. An average central London subterranean river can provide up to 19 MW cooling capacity, increasing discharged water temperature by 3°C, but also exceeding peak cooling demands. Though groundwater pumping rates (∼50 ls−1) prove unsustainable during summer months, water table recovery is observed as cooling demands are relieved.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Nutrient deficiencies limit human development and could be caused by the high cost of locally available foods needed to meet nutrient requirements. We aimed to identify the populations whose nutrient needs are most difficult to meet with existing global food systems. Methods: In this observational study, we used the International Comparison Program 2017 collection of global food prices to measure cost per day and cost per calorie of meeting nutrient needs, based on least-cost diets within upper and lower bounds for energy and 20 nutrients for healthy populations across 20 demographic groups in 172 countries. We then analysed the composition of these least-cost diets by food groups to estimate how the affordability of foods for meeting nutrient needs varied by age, sex, and reproductive status. Findings: In 2017, the global median of diet costs per day was US$2·32 (IQR 1·95–2·76), with cost highest for adolescent boys aged 14–18 years at $2·72 (2·31–3·15). For females, median cost was highest for adolescents aged 14–18 years during pregnancy and lactation at $2·64 (2·29–3·15), exceeding the cost for adult men aged 19–30 years. The global median of diet cost per 1000 kcal was $0·94 (IQR 0·80–1·12), and was higher for females throughout the life course than for males, peaking for adolescent girls aged 9–13 years ($1·17 [95% CI 1·15–1·19]) and women older than 70 years ($1·18 [1·17–1·19]). Diet costs were most sensitive to requirements for calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins C and E, as well as the upper bounds on carbohydrates and sodium. Total diet costs per day did not vary significantly with national income; however, in high-income countries, the composition of least-cost diets included more animal-source foods, whereas in low-income countries, diets with more pulses, nuts and seeds, and fruits and vegetables provided the most affordable way to meet nutrient requirements. Interpretation: Diets with adequate nutrients were unaffordable for many demographic groups, especially women and girls.

This paper explores the potential for sustainable MER fibre production, where all the required feedstocks could be from either renewable or waste origin. To investigate more sustainable pathways, the conventional process is compared to two alternatives processes which utilize waste CO2 and wood-based methanol for formalin production. A comparative environmental impact assessment is conducted, where selected environmental footprints, potential environmental impacts and eco-costs are analysed based on 1 kg of produced MER fibres. Results show that greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint could be reduced by over 68% and human toxicity potential by over 75%, while eco-costs could be reduced by up to 44%.

We assessed the burden and trends of LRIs and risk factors across all age groups by sex, for 204 countries and territories. Methods: In this analysis of data for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we used clinician-diagnosed pneumonia or bronchiolitis as our case definition for LRIs. We included International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes 079.6, 466–469, 470.0, 480–482.8, 483.0–483.9, 484.1–484.2, 484.6–484.7, and 487–489 and International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes A48.1, A70, B97.4–B97.6, J09–J15.8, J16–J16.9, J20–J21.9, J91.0, P23.0–P23.4, and U04–U04.9. We used the Cause of Death Ensemble modelling strategy to analyse 23 109 site-years of vital registration data, 825 site-years of sample vital registration data, 1766 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 681 site-years of mortality surveillance data. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to analyse age–sex-specific incidence and prevalence data identified via systematic reviews of the literature, population-based survey data, and claims and inpatient data. Additionally, we estimated age–sex-specific LRI mortality that is attributable to the independent effects of 14 risk factors. Findings: Globally, in 2019, we estimated that there were 257 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 240–275) LRI incident episodes in males and 232 million (217–248) in females. In the same year, LRIs accounted for 1·30 million (95% UI 1·18–1·42) male deaths and 1·20 million (1·07–1·33) female deaths. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were 1·17 times (95% UI 1·16–1·18) and 1·31 times (95% UI 1·23–1·41) greater in males than in females in 2019. Between 1990 and 2019, LRI incidence and mortality rates declined at different rates across age groups and an increase in LRI episodes and deaths was estimated among all adult age groups, with males aged 70 years and older having the highest increase in LRI episodes (126·0% [95% UI 121·4–131·1]) and deaths (100·0% [83·4–115·9]). During the same period, LRI episodes and deaths in children younger than 15 years were estimated to have decreased, and the greatest decline was observed for LRI deaths in males younger than 5 years (–70·7% [–77·2 to –61·8]). The leading risk factors for LRI mortality varied across age groups and sex. More than half of global LRI deaths in children younger than 5 years were attributable to child wasting (population attributable fraction [PAF] 53·0% [95% UI 37·7–61·8] in males and 56·4% [40·7–65·1] in females), and more than a quarter of LRI deaths among those aged 5–14 years were attributable to household air pollution (PAF 26·0% [95% UI 16·6–35·5] for males and PAF 25·8% [16·3–35·4] for females). PAFs of male LRI deaths attributed to smoking were 20·4% (95% UI 15·4–25·2) in those aged 15–49 years, 30·5% (24·1–36·9) in those aged 50–69 years, and 21·9% (16·8–27·3) in those aged 70 years and older. PAFs of female LRI deaths attributed to household air pollution were 21·1% (95% UI 14·5–27·9) in those aged 15–49 years and 18·2% (12·5–24·5) in those aged 50–69 years. For females aged 70 years and older, the leading risk factor, ambient particulate matter, was responsible for 11·7% (95% UI 8·2–15·8) of LRI deaths. Interpretation: The patterns and progress in reducing the burden of LRIs and key risk factors for mortality varied across age groups and sexes. The progress seen in children younger than 5 years was clearly a result of targeted interventions, such as vaccination and reduction of exposure to risk factors. Similar interventions for other age groups could contribute to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals targets, including promoting wellbeing at all ages and reducing health inequalities. Interventions, including addressing risk factors such as child wasting, smoking, ambient particulate matter pollution, and household air pollution, would prevent deaths and reduce health disparities.

However, the reported estimates do not address the renewal frequency and its association with the key parameter of road markings – retroreflectivity. This parameter, achieved because of a layer of glass beads on the road markings surface, fails before the plastic-bearing layer could be abraded. Field and laboratory assessment indicated the presence of several layers of paint and glass beads, confirming that the road markings were renewed before abrasion could occur. A methodology to employ luminance histograms to estimate loss of road markings was developed and used to approximate the emissions at selected exemplary locations. The estimates indicated that road marking loss at the most used areas of pedestrian crossings was below 6%, which is much less than previously reported. Thus, the emissions of microplastics of any dimension from this source were calculated to be between 0.1 and 4.3 g/person/year (except in Nordic countries, where 56.3 g/person/year could be reached).

Purpose: To translate the Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOLC) Scale in Hindi and assess its association with Kesslers's psychological distress scale (K-10) for determining the quality of life (QoL) of caregivers of patients with cancer in India. Methods: This is a single institute, hospital based cross sectional study performed from July 2020 to March 2021. Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOLC) Scale, employing standard ‘forward–backforward’ translation procedure, the English-language version of the questionnaire was translated into Hindi-language by experts and administered to each caregiver. Cronbach's alpha was used for internal consistency. Kesslers's psychological distress scale (K-10) was analysed on interview basis. Results: A total evaluated responders were 264. The hindi versions of the CQOLC was validated by cronbach's alpha method with internal consistency between 0.8 and 0.91. The majority of the caregivers were of the age group 31-40 yrs (42.05%). The male to female ratio was 6.54:1. CQOLC good score(0-45) was obtained in 27.27%, fair(46-90) in 55.30% and poor(91-140) in 17.42%. For K-10 distress scale very mild(10-19), mild(20-24), moderate(25-29) and severe(30-50) was observed in 47.73%, 11.74%, 11.74% and 28.79% respectively. A strong relation was found between the caregivers with poor CQOLC score and severe K-10 score(p<0.001). Conclusion: The Hindi version of CQOLC was accepted and its correlation with the point psychological distress predictor (K-10) scale was a valuable method to identify caregivers with poor QOL and severe distress levels.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 13: Climate action,"Leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue are three water-related diseases influenced by environmental factors. We examined whether seasonality and rainfall predict reported syndromes associated with leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue in Fiji. Poisson generalised linear models were fitted with s6 early warning, alert and response system (EWARS) syndromic conditions from March 2016 until December 2020, incorporating seasonality, temperature and rainfall. Watery diarrhoea, prolonged fever and suspected dengue displayed seasonal trends with peaks corresponding with the rainy season, while bloody diarrhoea, acute fever with rash and acute jaundice syndrome did not. Seasonality was the most common predictor for watery and bloody diarrhoea, prolonged fever, suspected dengue, and acute fever plus rash in those aged 5 and over, explaining between 0.4% – 37.8% of the variation across all conditions. Higher rainfall was the most common predictor for acute fever plus rash and acute jaundice syndrome in children under 5, explaining between 1.0% – 7.6% variation across all conditions. Each EWARS syndromic condition case peak was associated with a different rainfall lag, varying between 0 and 11 weeks. The relationships between EWARS, rainfall and seasonality show that it is possible to predict when outbreaks will occur by following seasonality and rainfall. Pre-positioning of diagnostic and treatment resources could then be aligned with seasonality and rainfall peaks to plan and address water-related disease outbreaks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We investigated the association of BP and hypertension treatment status with mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older women. Methods: We prospectively analysed a sample of 7207 community-dwelling women aged 65–79 years participating in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS). Participants were recruited between May 28, 1996, and Dec 13, 1999, at 39 US clinical centres, and they were followed up until Dec 31, 2019. Cognitive function was assessed annually. Mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia were defined through a centralised adjudication process. BP was measured by trained and certified staff at baseline. Pulse pressure (PP) was calculated as systolic BP (SBP) minus diastolic BP. Hypertension was defined using the American Heart Association 2017 Guideline for High BP in Adults. Outcomes were (1) mild cognitive impairment, (2) probable dementia, and (3) cognitive loss (the combined endpoint of either mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia, or both). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) to assess the association between hypertension, SBP, and PP with the risk of study outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression models, with adjustment for key covariates. Findings: During a median follow-up of 9 years (IQR 6–15), 1132 (15·7%) participants were classified as mild cognitive impairment, 739 (10·3%) as probable dementia, and 1533 (21·3%) as cognitive loss. The incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 15·3 cases (95% CI 14·4–16·2) for mild cognitive impairment, 9·7 cases (9·0–10·4) for probable dementia, and 20·3 (19·3–21·3) for cognitive loss. Elevated SBP and PP were significantly associated with increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and cognitive loss (test for trends across SBP and PP strata, p<0·01). Individuals with hypertension, but with controlled SBP of less than 120 mm Hg did not have a significantly increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (HR 1·33, 95% CI 0·98–1·82, p=0·071), and of cognitive loss (1·09, 0·82–1·44, p=0·57) compared with normotension. Individuals on anti-hypertensive treatment with PP of less than 50 mm Hg did not have a significantly higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (1·26, 0·98–1·62, p=0·07) and of cognitive loss (1·17, 0·94–1·46, p=0·16). There were no significant associations between hypertension, SBP, or PP and probable dementia. Interpretation: Results of our study show significant associations of hypertension and elevated SBP and PP levels with risk of mild cognitive impairment and the combined endpoint of either mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia, suggesting that intensive control of hypertension, SBP, and PP can preserve cognitive health in older women.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger,"Modern intensive agricultural practices face numerous challenges that pose major threats to global food security. In order to address the nutritional requirements of the ever-increasing world population, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are applied on large scale to increase crop production. However, the injudicious use of agrochemicals has resulted in environmental pollution leading to public health hazards. Moreover, agriculture soils are continuously losing their quality and physical properties as well as their chemical (imbalance of nutrients) and biological health. Plant-associated microbes with their plant growth- promoting traits have enormous potential to solve these challenges and play a crucial role in enhancing plant biomass and crop yield.

In this way, we were certain that there was an underlying mitochondrial dysfunction which could validate the biomarker. We found biomarkers of three classes: 1) functional markers measured in blood cells, 2) biochemical markers of serum/plasma and 3) DNA markers. While none of the reviewed single biomarkers may perfectly reveal all underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, combining biomarkers that cover different aspects of mitochondrial impairment probably is a good strategy. This biomarker panel may assist in the diagnosis of primary mitochondrial disease patients.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Aging is a global health challenge that is associated with a decline in cognitive function. In the United States, most older adults (≥50 years) do not meet the recommended daily fiber intake, although preliminary evidence suggests that dietary fiber consumption could elicit clinical benefits on cognitive function. We investigated the associations between dietary fiber intake and cognitive function in older adults. Methods: We analyzed data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2011 and 2014, with a study cohort of 1070 older adults (≥60 years). Cognitive function was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word Learning Test (WLT), Word Recall Test (WRT) and their Intrusion Word Count Tests (WLT-IC and WRT-IC), the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Multiple linear regression and cubic spline analyses were employed to examine the association between dietary fiber intake and cognitive performance on a test-by-test basis, after covariates adjustment (ie, age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, educational level, medical history, body mass index, alcohol, and energy intake). Results: Participants had a mean age of 69.2 years and were primarily non-Hispanic white of middle-high socioeconomic status with a college degree at minimum. The mean dietary fiber intake was 17.3 g/d. The analysis showed that dietary fiber intake was positively associated with DSST (P = .031). No associations with CERAD WLT (P = .41), WRT (P = .68), WLT-IC (P = .07), and WRT-IC (P = .28), and AFT (P = .40) scores were observed. A plateau in DSST score was revealed at a dietary fiber intake of 34 g/d. Conclusions: Higher dietary fiber intake is associated with improved specific components of cognitive function in older adults aged 60 years and older.

",Goal 13: Climate action,"Background: Climate change has important implications for the health and futures of children and young people, yet they have little power to limit its harm, making them vulnerable to climate anxiety. This is the first large-scale investigation of climate anxiety in children and young people globally and its relationship with perceived government response. Methods: We surveyed 10 000 children and young people (aged 16–25 years) in ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA; 1000 participants per country). Invitations to complete the survey were sent via the platform Kantar between May 18 and June 7, 2021. Data were collected on participants’ thoughts and feelings about climate change, and government responses to climate change. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each aspect of climate anxiety, and Pearson's correlation analysis was done to evaluate whether climate-related distress, functioning, and negative beliefs about climate change were linked to thoughts and feelings about government response. Findings: Respondents across all countries were worried about climate change (59% were very or extremely worried and 84% were at least moderately worried). More than 50% reported each of the following emotions: sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. More than 45% of respondents said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning, and many reported a high number of negative thoughts about climate change (eg, 75% said that they think the future is frightening and 83% said that they think people have failed to take care of the planet). Respondents rated governmental responses to climate change negatively and reported greater feelings of betrayal than of reassurance. Climate anxiety and distress were correlated with perceived inadequate government response and associated feelings of betrayal. Interpretation: Climate anxiety and dissatisfaction with government responses are widespread in children and young people in countries across the world and impact their daily functioning. A perceived failure by governments to respond to the climate crisis is associated with increased distress. There is an urgent need for further research into the emotional impact of climate change on children and young people and for governments to validate their distress by taking urgent action on climate change.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land,"Background: Previous studies focusing on urban, industrialised regions have found that excess heat exposure can increase all-cause mortality, heat-related illnesses, and occupational injuries. However, little research has examined how deforestation and climate change can adversely affect work conditions and population health in low latitude, industrialising countries. Methods: For this modelling study we used data at 1 km2 resolution to compare forest cover and temperature conditions in the Berau regency, Indonesia, between 2002 and 2018. We used spatially explicit satellite, climate model, and population data to estimate the effects of global warming, between 2002 and 2018 and after applying 1·0°C, 1·5°C, and 2·0°C of global warming to 2018 temperatures, on all-cause mortality and unsafe work conditions in the Berau regency, Indonesia. Findings: Between 2002 and 2018, 4375 km2 of forested land in Berau was cleared, corresponding to approximately 17% of the entire regency. Deforestation increased mean daily maximum temperatures by 0·95°C (95% CI 0·97–0·92; p<0·0001). Mean daily temperatures increased by a population-weighted 0·86°C, accounting for an estimated 7·3–8·5% of all-cause mortality (or 101–118 additional deaths per year) in 2018. Unsafe work time increased by 0·31 h per day (95% CI 0·30–0·32; p<0·0001) in deforested areas compared to 0·03 h per day (0·03–0·04; p<0·0001) in areas that maintained forest cover. With 2·0°C of additional future global warming, relative to 2018, deforested areas could experience an estimated 17–20% increase in all-cause mortality (corresponding to an additional 236–282 deaths per year) and up to 5 h of unsafe work per day. Interpretation: Heat exposure from deforestation and climate change has already started affecting populations in low latitude, industrialising countries, and future global warming indicates substantial health impacts in these regions.

Recent studies indicate that the changes in water yield, expressed through the n-parameter of Budyko framework, are associated with vegetation coverage changes. Here, we use runoff measurements and outputs from 13 dynamic global vegetation models, to investigate the underlying drivers of the n-parameter changes. Unlike previous studies, we instead find that climate change is the primary driver of adjustments on water resources. Changing climatic characteristics, particularly the intensity and seasonality of rainfall, modulates the runoff generation process. Indirect effects of climate change occur through altering vegetation properties, which in turn also impact river flow. We also find that in the arid and sparse vegetation regions, water yield is more sensitive to changes in n-parameter. Thus, the Budyko framework provides a reliable parameter-sparse representation of runoff changes, and reveals that terrestrial water cycle is changing substantially under climate change.

The strategy involves four complimentary work packages including data collection, development of a platform for data integration, application of the data for coastal change analyses and consultation with stakeholders. The last aims to assess the role of the integrated data systems to support strategic governance and sustainable decision-making. It is hoped that the output of this strategy would support the country's climate-focused agencies, organisations, decision-makers, and researchers in their tasks and endeavours.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

","Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities","Peru celebrates 200 years of independence in 2021. Over this period of independent life, and despite the turbulent socio-political scenarios, from internal armed conflict to economic crisis to political instability over the last 40 years, Peru has experienced major changes on its epidemiological and population health profile. Major advancements in maternal and child health as well as in communicable diseases have been achieved in recent decades, and today Peru faces an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases including mental health conditions. In terms of the configuration of the public health system, Peru has also strived to secure country-wide optimal health care, struggling in particular to improve primary health care and intercultural services. The science and technology infrastructure has also evolved, although the need for substantial investments remains if advancing science is to be a national priority. Climate change will also bring significant challenges to population health given Peru's geographical and microclimates diversity.

Using these estimates, we compute bias metrics given a classification model’s predictions. We leverage only names/zip codes; hence, our method is model and feature agnostic. Secondly, we offer an open-source Python package that produces a bias detection report based on our method.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Background: Diarrhoeal diseases are an important cause of mortality in children younger than 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to evaluate the effect of three handwashing interventions on handwashing with soap (HWWS) after toilet use. Methods: In this cluster randomised trial in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, we randomly assigned communal housing compounds (1:1:1) to receive one of three interventions: a theory of normative social behaviour (TNSB) intervention, including provision of handwashing stations; handwashing stations only; and no intervention. The TNSB intervention was designed to shift the outcome expectation associated with HWWS from health to riddance of faeces-related disgust, and to increase the perceived descriptive norm and perceived handwashing publicness. Participants and fieldworkers were masked to the study objectives. The primary outcome was HWWS after toilet use, assessed at 1 month and 5 months follow-ups. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201501000892239. Findings: Between April 10 and May 22, 2014, we identified 92 eligible compounds, of which 75 compounds were included. Follow-up data on HWWS were available for 23 compounds for the TNSB group, 25 compounds for the handwashing station-only group, and 25 compounds for the control group. The study ended in April, 2017. Compared with a frequency of 5% (29 of 604 occasions) in the control group, HWWS after toilet use increased to 9% (49 of 557 occasions; adjusted risk ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·16–3·08) in the handwashing station-only group, and 24% (143 of 588 occasions; 4·82, 3·06–7·59) in the TNSB group, at the 1-month follow-up. The intervention effect was only sustained in the TNSB group (98 [22%] of 450 compounds; 2·68, 1·65–4·34). Interpretation: A social norm-based handwashing intervention combined with disgust-inducing messages, with provision of handwashing stations, was effective at increasing HWWS after toilet use. The provision of handwashing stations alone had little effect. Future studies should investigate whether the same approach, when delivered via mass media, can have a similar effect to the face-to-face delivery used in this study.

This burden may be overwhelming in low income countries, although there are insufficient data. Most antidepressant formulations are predicated on the monoamine, neuroendocrine and neuro-inflammation hypotheses, with little or no cognizance to other neurochemicals altered in depression. A nutritional strategy with or without conventional antidepressants is recommended, as nutrition plays vital roles in the onset, severity and duration of depression, with poor nutrition contributing to its pathogenesis. This review discusses nutritional potentials of utilizing omega-3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, minerals and herbs or their phytochemicals in the management of depression with the aim of reducing depression burden. Literature search of empirical data in books and journals in data bases including but not limited to PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar that might contain discussions of sampling were sought, their full text obtained, and searched for relevant content to determine eligibility. Omega-3 fatty and amino acids had significant positive anti-depression outcomes, while vitamins and minerals although essential, enhanced omega-3 fatty and amino acids activities. Some herbs either as whole extracts or their phytochemicals/metabolites had significant positive anti-depression efficacy. Nutrition through the application of necessary food classes or herbs as well as their phytochemicals, may go a long way to effectively manage depression.

The legacy of marriage: Using food to challenge traditional gender norms in widowhood,/articles/legacy-marriage-using-food-challenge-traditional-gender-norms-widowhood,"Gender norms also apply to the expectations around food and cooking. ""I am a widow therefore I can cook: I am a widower therefore I need someone to cook for me"" is unfounded.
",Goal 5: Gender equality; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Studies on aging tend to apply a traditional approach to gender roles. This is especially evident in studies of widowhood, as responses to this life transition tend to be shaped by gender. Studies on food and widowhood in old age suggest that men and women differ when it comes to food related life after the loss of a spouse. As the traditionalist story goes, men face practical challenges because they lack cooking skills whereas women face emotional challenges because they are no longer the food provider. However, this research often overlooks that married couples may have had non-traditional ways of dividing domestic household tasks, and that this division of labor is likely to have affected the way in which widows and widowers experience and handle food related challenges. Applying a life course perspective to 31 qualitative interviews, I show that the way older men and women adjust to food activities in widowhood is shaped by the way these activities were shared in their marriage rather than by gender per se.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Scale and scope economies in small household rice farming in Vietnam,/articles/scale-and-scope-economies-small-household-rice-farming-vietnam,"The present study is the first applications of the input-oriented stochastic distance function approach in estimating scale and scope economies using data of multi-crop farming households in Vietnam.
",Goal 2: Zero hunger,"The Vietnamese agricultural sector has experienced a dramatic structural change based on increased specialization in rice cultivation. However, small-scale rice-farmers have continued to grow multiple crops, especially in less developed provinces. While the literature advocates crop diversification for reasons of both economic and ecological sustainability, there lacks empirical evidence as to whether crop diversification brings efficiency and productivity gains to small farms. The present study is the first applications of the input-oriented stochastic distance function approach in estimating scale and scope economies using data of multi-crop farming households in Vietnam. We find strong evidence of product-specific economies of scale. Scope economies are also present for rice, vegetable, and other annual crop production. This suggests that crop diversification enhances efficiency and productivity. However, there still exists significant technical inefficiency in crop production, indicating opportunities to expand farm output at the existing level of inputs and technologies. More specifically, our empirical results indicate that it is desirable to expand vegetable and other annual crop production in mountainous areas while rice cultivation can be further expanded in delta and coastal regions.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ecologically significant applications of Pseudomonas in biocontrol and bioaugmentation are crucial for maintaining food security.
",Goal 2: Zero hunger,"Numerous microbial communities show synergistic and antagonistic interactions among themselves, resulting in benefit and harm to either or both the associated members. The association holds accountability for nutrients recycling and energy drift, resulting in the availability of macronutrients unavailable and insoluble forms of rhizospheric nutrients, crucial for vital processes in plants, e.g., act as co-factors of various phyto-enzyme and redox mediators. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria are known to enhance plant growth by increasing these macronutrients availability during their plant root colonization. In comparison to any other genera, Pseudomonas is the most favored bioinoculant due to its significant properties in both plant growth and phytopathogen control during its synergistic association with the host plant. These properties include siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, phenazines, antibiotics, and induced systemic resistance carried out by various Pseudomonas species like Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas syringae. The association of Pseudomonas with crop plants procures several secretory and electron-based feedback mechanisms in order to regulate the plant growth and phytopathogen control activities through the secretion of several phytohormones (auxins, gibberellins, Indole-3-acetic acid), secondary metabolites (flavonoids) and enzymes (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase).

Previous studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human ovary, the core organ of the female reproductive system. However, it remains unclear which type of ovarian cells are easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 and whether ovarian infectivity differs from puberty to menopause. In this study, public datasets containing bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data derived from ovarian tissues were analyzed to demonstrate the mRNA expression and protein distribution of the two key entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2). Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human ovaries of different ages was conducted. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis of ovaries of different ages and with varying ovarian reserves was conducted to explore the potential functions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the ovary. The analysis of the public datasets indicated that the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed mostly in oocytes and partially in granulosa cells. However, no marked difference was observed in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression between young and old ovaries and ovaries with low and high reserves. Correspondingly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were detected in the human ovarian cortex and medulla, especially in oocytes of different stages, with no observed variations in their expression level in ovaries of different ages, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatic analyses. Remarkably, DEG analysis showed that a series of viral infection-related pathways were more enriched in ACE2-positive ovarian cells than in ACE2-negative ovarian cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially target specific ovarian cells and affect ovarian function.

Autochthony and investment beliefs as bases for territorial ownership and compensation in settler societies: The case of Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups in Chile,/articles/autochthony-and-investment-beliefs-bases-territorial-ownership-and-compensation-settler,"A discussion of how well indigenous people should be compensated if their land needs to be developed.
",Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 1: No poverty,"We examined how autochthony belief (entitlements from first arrival) and investment belief (entitlements from working the land) guide attitudes towards territorial compensation of Indigenous groups in settler societies. We expected autochthony and investment beliefs to be respectively related to more and less territorial compensation, via higher and lower perceptions of Indigenous ownership. We tested this in Chile among non-Indigenous Chileans and Indigenous Mapuche. In Study 1 among non-Indigenous Chilean students (N = 611) we found that autochthony belief was related to a greater support for territorial compensation of the first inhabitants, the Mapuche, whereas investment belief was related to a lesser support for territorial compensation. In Study 2 we contrasted self-identified non-Indigenous Chileans (N = 121) with self-identified Indigenous Mapuche (N = 226) and found that for both groups autochthony belief was related to greater support for territorial compensation via higher recognition of Indigenous territorial ownership. Interestingly, for non-Indigenous Chileans, investment belief was related to less willingness to compensate, whereas for Mapuche it was related to more claims for compensation via stronger perceptions of Indigenous ownership. Together, these findings show that endorsement of autochthony belief is an argument that validates Indigenous ownership among both groups, whereas different dimensions of the investment belief can be used by both groups to claim more positive outcomes for their own in-group.

The findings suggest that ensuring high ecological protection would put nearly half the world's population under water stress for at least 1 month per year, meaning important trade-offs are made when allocating limited water resources between direct human needs and the environment.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Background: Increasing human demand for water and changes in water availability due to climate change threatens water security worldwide. Additionally, exploitation of water resources induces stress on freshwater environments, leading to biodiversity loss and reduced ecosystem services. We aimed to conduct a spatially detailed assessment of global human water stress for low to high environmental flow (EF) protection. Methods: In this modelling study, we used the LISFLOOD model to generate daily natural flows without anthropogenic water use for 1980–2018. On the basis of these flows, we selected three EF methods (EF with high ecological protection [EFPROT], EF with minimum flow requirements [EFMIN], and variable monthly flow [EFVMF]) to calculate monthly EFs. We assessed monthly consumptive water use for industry, agricultural crops, livestock, municipalities, and energy production for 2010. We then estimated the corresponding number of people under water stress per month on a global and national level using a spatially detailed population database for 2010. Findings: We estimate that 3·2 billion (EFPROT), 2·4 billion (EFVMF), and 2·2 billion (EFMIN) people lived under water stress for at least 1 month per year, corresponding to 46%, 35%, and 32% of the world's population in 2010, respectively. Around 80% of people living under water stress lived in Asia; in particular, India, Pakistan, and northeast China. Compared with EFMIN, imposing EFPROT globally would have put between 710 million (March) to 1 billion (June) additional people under water stress on a monthly basis, whereas this would have been 72 million (August) to 218 million (April) additional people if EFVMF were imposed. Interpretation: Ensuring high ecological protection would put nearly half of the world's population (3·2 billion people) under water stress for at least 1 month per year.

To assess the potential co-benefits from shifting to more sustainable diets, we aimed to investigate the associations of dietary greenhouse gas emissions and land use with all-cause and cause-specific mortality and cancer incidence rates. Methods: Using data from 443 991 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a multicentre prospective cohort, we estimated associations between dietary contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and land use and all-cause and cause-specific mortality and incident cancers using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The main exposures were modelled as quartiles. Co-benefits, encompassing the potential effects of alternative diets on all-cause mortality and cancer and potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and land use, were estimated with counterfactual attributable fraction intervention models, simulating potential effects of dietary shifts based on the EAT–Lancet reference diet. Findings: In the pooled analysis, there was an association between levels of dietary greenhouse gas emissions and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·13 [95% CI 1·10–1·16]) and between land use and all-cause mortality (1·18 [1·15–1·21]) when comparing the fourth quartile to the first quartile. Similar associations were observed for cause-specific mortality. Associations were also observed between all-cause cancer incidence rates and greenhouse gas emissions, when comparing the fourth quartile to the first quartile (adjusted HR 1·11 [95% CI 1·09–1·14]) and between all-cause cancer incidence rates and land use (1·13 [1·10–1·15]); however, estimates differed by cancer type. Through counterfactual attributable fraction modelling of shifts in levels of adherence to the EAT–Lancet diet, we estimated that up to 19–63% of deaths and up to 10–39% of cancers could be prevented, in a 20-year risk period, by different levels of adherence to the EAT–Lancet reference diet. Additionally, switching from lower adherence to the EAT–Lancet reference diet to higher adherence could potentially reduce food-associated greenhouse gas emissions up to 50% and land use up to 62%. Interpretation: Our results indicate that shifts towards universally sustainable diets could lead to co-benefits, such as minimising diet-related greenhouse gas emissions and land use, reducing the environmental footprint, aiding in climate change mitigation, and improving population health.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background: The consumption of ultra-processed foods has increased worldwide and has been related to the occurrence of obesity and other non-communicable diseases. However, little is known about the environmental effects of ultra-processed foods. We aimed to assess the temporal trends in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), water footprint, and ecological footprint of food purchases in Brazilian metropolitan areas, and how these are affected by the amount of food processing. Methods: In this time-series study, we used data from five Brazilian Household Budget Surveys (1987–88, 1995–96, 2002–03, 2008–09, 2017–18) to calculate GHGE, water footprint, and ecological footprint per 1000 kcal of food and beverages purchased. Food items were classified into NOVA food groups: unprocessed or minimally processed foods (G1); processed culinary ingredients (G2); processed foods (G3); and ultra-processed foods (G4). We calculated the proportion each NOVA food group contributes to daily kcal per person. Linear regression was performed to evaluate trends of the environmental impacts across the years. Findings: Between 1987–88 and 2017–18, diet-related GHGE increased by 21% (from 1538·6 g CO2 equivalent [CO2e] per 1000 kcal [95% CI 1473·3–1604·0] to 1866·0 g CO2e per 1000 kcal [1788·0–1944·0]; ptrend<0·0001), diet-related water footprint increased by 22% (from 1447·2 L/1000 kcal [95% CI 1400·7–1493·8] to 1769·1 L/1000 kcal [1714·5–1823·7]; ptrend<0·0001), and diet-related ecological footprint increased by 17% (from 9·69 m2/1000 kcal [95% CI 9·33–10·05] to 11·36 m2/1000 kcal [10·91–11·81]; ptrend<0·0001). We found that the change in the environmental indicators over time varied between NOVA food groups. We did not find evidence of a change in the environmental indicators for G1 foods over time. GHGE from G2 foods decreased by 18% (ptrend<0·0001), whereas GHGE from G4 foods increased by 245% (ptrend<0·0001). The water footprint from G2 foods decreased by 17% (ptrend<0·0001) whereas the water footprint from G4 foods increased by 233% (ptrend<0·0001). The ecological footprint from G2 foods decreased by 13% (ptrend<0·0001), whereas the ecological footprint from G3 foods increased by 49% (ptrend<0·0001) and from G4 foods increased by 183% (ptrend<0·0001). We found no significant change in contribution by any other NOVA food groups to any of the three environmental indicators over the study period. Interpretation: The environmental effects of the Brazilian diet have increased over the past three decades along with increased effects from ultra-processed foods. This means that dietary patterns in Brazil are becoming potentially more harmful to human and planetary health. Therefore, a shift in the current trend would be needed to enhance sustainable healthy food systems.

The global and regional costs of healthy and sustainable dietary patterns: a modelling study,/articles/global-and-regional-costs-healthy-and-sustainable-dietary-patterns-modelling-study,"An Article in support of SDGs 2 and 12, assessing the financial costs of healthy and sustainable diets in countries with different income levels
",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production,"Background: Adoption of healthy and sustainable diets could be essential for safe-guarding the Earth's natural resources and reducing diet-related mortality, but their adoption could be hampered if such diets proved to be more expensive and unaffordable for some populations. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the costs of healthy and sustainable diets around the world. Methods: In this modelling study, we used regionally comparable food prices from the International Comparison Program for 150 countries. We paired those prices with estimates of food demand for different dietary patterns that, in modelling studies, have been associated with reductions in premature mortality and environmental resource demand, including nutritionally balanced flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets. We used estimates of food waste and projections of food demand and prices to specify food system and socioeconomic change scenarios up to 2050. In the full cost accounting, we estimated diet-related health-care costs by pairing a comparative risk assessment of dietary risks with cost-of-illness estimates, and we estimated climate change costs by pairing the diet scenarios with greenhouse gas emission footprints and estimates of the social cost of carbon. Findings: Compared with the cost of current diets, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were, depending on the pattern, up to 22–34% lower in cost in upper-middle-income to high-income countries on average (when considering statistical means), but at least 18–29% more expensive in lower-middle-income to low-income countries. Reductions in food waste, a favourable socioeconomic development scenario, and a fuller cost accounting that included the diet-related costs of climate change and health care in the cost of diets increased the affordability of the dietary patterns in our future projections. When these measures were combined, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were up to 25–29% lower in cost in low-income to lower-middle-income countries, and up to 37% lower in cost on average, for the year 2050. Variants of vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns were generally most affordable, and pescatarian diets were least affordable. Interpretation: In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, dietary change interventions that incentivise adoption of healthy and sustainable diets can help consumers in those countries reduce costs while, at the same time, contribute to fulfilling national climate change commitments and reduce public health spending. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, healthy and sustainable diets are substantially less costly than western diets and can also be cost-competitive in the medium-to-long term, subject to beneficial socioeconomic development and reductions in food waste. A fuller accounting of the costs of diets would make healthy and sustainable diets the least costly option in most countries in the future.

The scarcity of food for the rising population is a critical issue faced by the world in wake of the unpredicted change in climatic conditions. The aquaculture industry plays an important role in solving global food scarcity. It is projected that the share of fish for human consumption originating from aquaculture is projected to increase from 52% (average for the period 2016–2018) to 58% in 2028. The major adverse impact of the traditional aquaculture systems includes the effect on water quality and secondary pollution causing serious damage to the aquatic resources. Improving water recycling efficiency and reducing the discharge of wastewater are the major factors contributing to sustainable aquaculture system. The present study compares the various aquaculture wastewater treatment technologies and their role in achieving sustainability. Recirculation systems in aquaculture units are found to be more effective in managing the volume of wastewater since only 10% of the total volume of water is replaced per day and hence more sustainable. Constructed wetland systems have reported high efficiency in the treatment of wastewater containing nitrogen compounds with NH4-N removal of 86—98% and NO2-N removal efficiency exceeds 99%. The cumulative energy demand of RAFT (Rafter System) and MFBS (Media-Filled Beds System) in Coupled Aquaponics Systems (CAPS) has been reduced to 46.8% and 53.2% which is very less than conventional units. The study of the use of local and low trophic level biomass like microalgae as feedstock was found to reduce the environmental impacts of fish farming with added benefit of biomass production and lipid production. The algae harvesting efficiency of above 90% has been achieved by using proper coagulants in various units. The study of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture operation, combining fed aquaculture with organic extractive aquaculture was found to improve the shellfish output by 20%, and profit was over 230% and 68% greater than that in finfish and shellfish isolated monocultures.

Customary water resources governance in the Faase community of Ghana,/articles/customary-water-resources-governance-faase-community-ghana,"This paper explores a customary system of water governance in Ghana.  
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"The relevance of customary water governance system which served many communities well over centuries has reduced drastically. This is due to the introduction of the statutory system of governance. For some communities, this means scraping the indigenous customary practices that formed part of their daily activities. For many years, the Faase community in the Ga West Municipality of Ghana, practised customary water resources governance though this is currently at risk of being scraped off by the statutory system of water governance. It is, therefore, imperative to examine the structures and mechanisms that sustained the customary system of water governance within this community to improve an evolving integrated water management system. This paper explores the structures and institutions involved in customary water resources governance and assesses how this system provided sustainable water resources governance in the community. In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted involving five traditional authorities who were purposively selected. In addition, a total of four Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), made up forty-three community members were conducted. The data gathered were transcribed, coded and themed for discussion. It was found that customary water governance gave the Faase community its main identity and it remained effective because of the structures and mechanisms put in place by their traditional system.

"Hospital-treated infectious diseases and the risk of dementia: a large, multicohort, observational study with a replication cohort",/articles/hospital-treated-infectious-diseases-and-risk-dementia-large-multicohort-observational,"An article, in the context of SDG 3, analysing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias across a range of hospital-treated bacterial and viral infections in two large cohorts.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Infections have been hypothesised to increase the risk of dementia. Existing studies have included a narrow range of infectious diseases, relied on short follow-up periods, and provided little evidence for whether the increased risk is limited to specific dementia subtypes or attributable to specific microbes rather than infection burden. We aimed to compare the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias across a wide range of hospital-treated bacterial and viral infections in two large cohorts with long follow-up periods. Methods: In this large, multicohort, observational study, the analysis was based on a primary cohort consisting of pooled individual-level data from three prospective cohort studies in Finland (the Finnish Public Sector study, the Health and Social Support study, and the Still Working study) and an independent replication cohort from the UK Biobank. Community-dwelling adults (≥18 years) with no dementia at study entry were included. Follow-up was until Dec 31, 2012, in the Health and Social Support study, Dec 31, 2016, in the public sector study and the Still Working study, and Feb 7, 2018, in the replication cohort. Through record linkage to national hospital inpatient registers, we ascertained exposure to 925 infectious diseases (using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes) before dementia onset, and identified incident dementia from hospital records, medication reimbursement entitlements, and death certificates. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations of each infectious disease or disease group (index infection) with incident dementia were assessed by use of Cox proportional hazards models. We then repeated the analysis after excluding incident dementia cases that occurred during the first 10 years after initial hospitalisation due to the index infection. Findings: From March 1, 1986, to Jan 1, 2005, 260 490 people were included in the primary cohort, and from Dec 19, 2006, to Oct 1, 2010, 485 708 people were included in the replication cohort. In the primary cohort analysis based on 3 947 046 person-years at risk (median follow-up 15·4 years [IQR 9·8–21·0]), 77 108 participants had at least one hospital-treated infection before dementia onset and 2768 developed dementia. Hospitalisation for any infectious disease was associated with increased dementia risk in the primary cohort (adjusted HR [aHR] 1·48 [95% CI 1·37–1·60]) and replication cohort (2·60 [2·38-2·83]). The association remained when analyses were restricted to new dementia cases that occurred more than 10 years after infection (aHR 1·22 [95% CI 1·09–1·36] in the primary cohort, the replication cohort had insufficient follow-up data for this analysis), and when comorbidities and other dementia risk factors were considered. There was evidence of a dose-response association between the number of episodes of hospital-treated infections and dementia risk in both cohorts (ptrend=0·0007). Although the greatest dementia risk was seen for central nervous system (CNS) infections versus no infection (aHR 3·01 [95% CI 2·07–4·37]), excess risk was also evident for extra-CNS infections (1·47 [1·36–1·59]). Although we found little difference in the infection-dementia association by type of infection, associations were stronger for vascular dementia than for Alzheimer's disease (aHR 2·09 [95% CI 1·59–2·75] versus aHR 1·20 [1·08–1·33] in the primary cohort and aHR 3·28 [2·65–4·04] versus aHR 1·80 [1·53–2·13] in the replication cohort). Interpretation: Severe infections requiring hospital treatment are associated with long-term increased risk of dementia, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This association is not limited to CNS infections, suggesting that systemic effects are sufficient to affect the brain. The absence of infection specificity combined with evidence of dose-response relationships between infectious disease burden and dementia risk support the hypothesis that increased dementia risk is driven by general inflammation rather than specific microbes.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Drugs modifying angiotensin II signalling could reduce Alzheimer's disease pathology, thus decreasing the rate of disease progression. We investigated whether the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, compared with placebo, could reduce brain volume loss, as a measure of disease progression, in clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Methods: In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial, eligible patients aged 55 years or older, previously untreated with angiotensin II drugs and diagnosed (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, and who had capacity to consent, were recruited from 23 UK National Health Service hospital trusts. After undergoing a 4-week, open-label phase of active treatment then washout, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) oral over-encapsulated preparations of either 100 mg losartan (after an initial two-dose titration stage) or matched placebo daily for 12 months. Randomisation, minimised by age and baseline medial temporal lobe atrophy score, was undertaken online or via pin-access service by telephone. Participants, their study companions, and study personnel were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome, analysed by the intention-to-treat principle (ie, participants analysed in the group to which they were randomised, without imputation for missing data), was change in whole brain volume between baseline and 12 months, measured using volumetric MRI and determined by boundary shift interval (BSI) analysis. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register (ISRCTN93682878) and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 2012–003641–15), and is completed. Findings: Between July 22, 2014, and May 17, 2018, 261 participants entered the open-label phase. 211 were randomly assigned losartan (n=105) or placebo (n=106). Of 197 (93%) participants who completed the study, 171 (81%) had complete primary outcome data. The mean brain volume (BSI) reduction was 19·1 mL (SD 10·3) in the losartan group and 20·0 mL (10·8) in the placebo group. The difference in total volume reduction between groups was –2·29 mL (95% CI –6·46 to 0·89; p=0·14). The number of adverse events was low (22 in the losartan group and 20 in the placebo group) with no differences between treatment groups. There was one treatment-related death per treatment group. Interpretation: 12 months of treatment with losartan was well tolerated but was not effective in reducing the rate of brain atrophy in individuals with clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Further research is needed to assess the potential therapeutic benefit from earlier treatment in patients with milder cognitive impairment or from longer treatment periods.

This study examines the presence and extent of under-reporting of police violence in US Government-run vital registration data, offers a method for correcting under-reporting in these datasets, and presents revised estimates of deaths due to police violence in the USA. Methods: We compared data from the USA National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) to three non-governmental, open-source databases on police violence: Fatal Encounters, Mapping Police Violence, and The Counted. We extracted and standardised the age, sex, US state of death registration, year of death, and race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic of other races, and Hispanic of any race) of each decedent for all data sources and used a network meta-regression to quantify the rate of under-reporting within the NVSS. Using these rates to inform correction factors, we provide adjusted estimates of deaths due to police violence for all states, ages, sexes, and racial and ethnic groups from 1980 to 2019 across the USA. Findings: Across all races and states in the USA, we estimate 30 800 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 30 300–31 300) from police violence between 1980 and 2018; this represents 17 100 more deaths (16 600–17 600) than reported by the NVSS. Over this time period, the age-standardised mortality rate due to police violence was highest in non-Hispanic Black people (0·69 [95% UI 0·67–0·71] per 100 000), followed by Hispanic people of any race (0·35 [0·34–0·36]), non-Hispanic White people (0·20 [0·19–0·20]), and non-Hispanic people of other races (0·15 [0·14– 0·16]). This variation is further affected by the decedent's sex and shows large discrepancies between states. Between 1980 and 2018, the NVSS did not report 55·5% (54·8–56·2) of all deaths attributable to police violence. When aggregating all races, the age-standardised mortality rate due to police violence was 0·25 (0·24–0·26) per 100 000 in the 1980s and 0·34 (0·34–0·35) per 100 000 in the 2010s, an increase of 38·4% (32·4–45·1) over the period of study. Interpretation: We found that more than half of all deaths due to police violence that we estimated in the USA from 1980 to 2018 were unreported in the NVSS. Compounding this, we found substantial differences in the age-standardised mortality rate due to police violence over time and by racial and ethnic groups within the USA. Proven public health intervention strategies are needed to address these systematic biases. State-level estimates allow for appropriate targeting of these strategies to address police violence and improve its reporting.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The sustainable development goals (SDGs) aim to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Understanding the current state of the HIV epidemic and its change over time is essential to this effort. This study assesses the current sex-specific HIV burden in 204 countries and territories and measures progress in the control of the epidemic. Methods: To estimate age-specific and sex-specific trends in 48 of 204 countries, we extended the Estimation and Projection Package Age-Sex Model to also implement the spectrum paediatric model. We used this model in cases where age and sex specific HIV-seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care-clinic sentinel surveillance data were available. For the remaining 156 of 204 locations, we developed a cohort-incidence bias adjustment to derive incidence as a function of cause-of-death data from vital registration systems. The incidence was input to a custom Spectrum model. To assess progress, we measured the percentage change in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 (threshold >75% decline), the ratio of incident cases to number of people living with HIV (incidence-to-prevalence ratio threshold <0·03), and the ratio of incident cases to deaths (incidence-to-mortality ratio threshold <1·0). Findings: In 2019, there were 36·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 35·1–38·9) people living with HIV worldwide. There were 0·84 males (95% UI 0·78–0·91) per female living with HIV in 2019, 0·99 male infections (0·91–1·10) for every female infection, and 1·02 male deaths (0·95–1·10) per female death. Global progress in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 was driven by sub-Saharan Africa (with a 28·52% decrease in incident cases, 95% UI 19·58–35·43, and a 39·66% decrease in deaths, 36·49–42·36). Elsewhere, the incidence remained stable or increased, whereas deaths generally decreased. In 2019, the global incidence-to-prevalence ratio was 0·05 (95% UI 0·05–0·06) and the global incidence-to-mortality ratio was 1·94 (1·76–2·12). No regions met suggested thresholds for progress. Interpretation: Sub-Saharan Africa had both the highest HIV burden and the greatest progress between 1990 and 2019. The number of incident cases and deaths in males and females approached parity in 2019, although there remained more females with HIV than males with HIV. Globally, the HIV epidemic is far from the UNAIDS benchmarks on progress metrics.

Polypharmacy-associated risk of hospitalisation among people ageing with and without HIV: an observational study,/articles/polypharmacy-associated-risk-hospitalisation-among-people-ageing-and-without-hiv,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 10, assessing whether people ageing with HIV have more drug-drug interactions than those without HIV, and whether this confers greater risk of hospitalisation.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Polypharmacy, defined as use of five or more medications concurrently, is associated with adverse health outcomes and people ageing with HIV might be at greater risk than similar uninfected individuals. We aimed to determine whether known pairwise drug interactions (KPDIs) were associated with risk of admission to hospital (hereafter referred to as hospitalisation) and medication count among people ageing with and without HIV after accounting for physiological frailty. Methods: In this observational study, we collected individual-level data for participants of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and with supressed HIV-1 RNA and people without HIV who were receiving at least one prescription medication, based on active medications in the 2009 fiscal year (ie, Oct 1, 2008, to Sept 30, 2009). We identified KPDIs among these patients by linking prescription fill and refill data with data from DrugBank (version 5.0.11). We collected data on all-cause mortality and hospitalisations between Oct 1, 2009, and March 31, 2019. We compared KPDI counts using random selection and actual patterns of use across medication counts from two to 12. We created a weighted KPDI Index on the basis of the average association of each KPDI with mortality among people ageing without HIV and used nested Cox models stratified by HIV status to estimate the association between medication count and hospitalisation, with incremental adjustments for demographics, physiological frailty, and KPDI Index. Findings: We collected data for 9186 people ageing with HIV and 37 930 individuals without HIV. 45 913 (97·4%) of 47 116 patients were men and the sample was predominantly aged 50–64 years (30 413 [64·6%]). Compared with a random sample of medications, real-world pattern of medication counts and combinations were associated with five-to-six times more KPDIs (eg, for a combination of six medications, KPDI count was 1·09 in the random sample, 5·49 in the HIV-negative population, and 7·13 in the HIV-positive population). For each additional observed medication, people ageing with HIV had approximately 2·94 additional KPDIs and comparators had approximately 2·67 additional KPDIs. Adjustment for demographics, physiological frailty, and KPDI Index reduced the association between medication count and risk of hospitalisation for people ageing with HIV (hazard ratio 1·08 [95% CI 1·07–1·09] reduced to 1·06 [1·05–1·07]) and those without HIV (1·08 [1·07–1·08] reduced to 1·04 [1·03–1·05]). Interpretation: For each additional medication, people ageing with HIV have more drug–drug interactions than those without HIV. Adjusting for known non-ART drug–drug interactions, each additional non-ART medication confers excess risk of hospitalisation for people ageing with HIV. Randomised trials will be needed to determine whether reducing these interactions improves outcomes.

We combined TB public health surveillance data with genomic sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the tropical ‘Top End’ of the NT to investigate trends in TB incidence and transmission. Methods: This retrospective observational study included all 741 culture-confirmed cases of TB in the Top End over three decades from 1989–2020. All 497 available M. tuberculosis isolates were sequenced. We used contact tracing data to define a threshold pairwise SNP distance for hierarchical single linkage clustering, and examined putative transmission clusters in the context of epidemiologic information. Findings: There were 359 (48%) cases born overseas, 329 (44%) cases among Australian First Nations peoples, and 52 (7%) cases were Australian-born and non-Indigenous. The annual incidence in First Nations peoples from 1989-2019 fell from average 50.4 to 11.0 per 100,000 (P<0·001). First Nations cases were more likely to die from TB (41/329, 12·5%) than overseas-born cases (11/359, 3·1%; P<0·001). Using a threshold of ≤12 SNPs, 28 clusters of between 2–64 individuals were identified, totalling 250 cases; 214 (86%) were First Nations cases and 189 (76%) were from a remote region.

Ave River Basin requires landscape intervention to restore hydric resources.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"The preservation of water resources is a worldwide goal that requires continuous research to support the action of decision-makers. The learning about water quality is paramount in that regard to assess the complex interactions between surface waters and pollution sources. To assess the impact of diffuse pressures, many authors established nexus between landscape metrics and surface water quality. The present study used that approach in a Portuguese urban catchment, the Ave River Basin. The relation between landscape metrics and eight surface water quality parameters was studied during 26 hydrological years, based on the Spearman's rank correlation analysis. The correlation analysis exposed strong relationships between water quality and parameters that describe land use composition or configuration. During the studied period, even in recent years, the water quality parameters reached concentrations above the legally recommended limits. The most concerning parameters were ammoniacal nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand and total orthophosphate. Among the analysed metrics, Shannon's diversity index, percentage of urban areas, and the percentage of agricultural edges that are shared with artificial areas were the most preoccupying land use characteristics that indicate degradation of water resources. Besides the correlations, the study calculated the variation rates of land use maps relative to the years of 1995, 2007, 2010, 2015 and 2018. The results of correlation analysis and land use changes identified actions for the short-term that could improve water quality in the Ave River, namely a reduction in agricultural fields and an increase of forest edges density.

Comprehensive comparison of artificial neural networks and long short-term memory networks for rainfall-runoff simulation,/articles/comprehensive-comparison-artificial-neural-networks-and-long-short-term-memory-networks,"This study provides new insights into the potential use of machine learning in hydrological simulations.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Accurate and efficient runoff simulations are crucial for water management in basins. Rainfall-runoff simulation approaches range between physical, conceptual, and data-driven models. With the recent development of machine-learning techniques, machine learning methods have been widely applied in the field of hydrology. Existing studies show that such methods can achieve comparable or even better performances than conventional hydrological models in runoff simulation. In particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are able to overcome the shortcomings of traditional neural network methods in handling time series data. However, the impacts of the time memory on rainfall-runoff simulation are rarely studied. In this study, hysteresis effects in hydrology were investigated and the performances of machine learning methods and traditional hydrological models were assessed. The results show that the ANN model is more suitable for monthly scale simulation, while the LSTM model performs better at daily scale. Hydrological hysteresis is important for runoff simulations when using machine learning methods, especially at daily scale. By considering hysteresis in the simulation, the RMSE is significantly improved by 27% (21%) for LSTM (ANN). In addition, LSTM is more robust for time series handling, while the ANN is easier to be overfitted due to the limitation of neural network structure.

The authors highlight a valid concern of unintended consequences of COVID-19 transmission through changing humidity levels through heat mitigation strategies such as evaporative cooling. Systematic reviews of meteorological conditions and COVID-19 continue to hint at a “seasonality” effect for transmission and mortality; however, associations with outdoor humidity levels are far more mixed than relationships with ambient air temperature[1], [2], [3]. Evolving science confirms that most COVID-19 transmission occurs indoors where humidity likely impacts droplet and aerosol size, virus stability, and thus transport trajectory and transmission rates[4].

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production,"Background: High meat consumption, particularly red meat and processed meat, negatively affects our health, while meat production is one of the largest contributors to global warming and environmental degradation. The aim of our study was to explore trends in meat consumption within the UK and the associated changes in environmental impact. We also aimed to identify any differences in intake associated with gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and year of birth. Methods: Our study aimed to describe consumption of red, white, and processed meat within the UK, using data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey rolling programme (2008–09 to 2018–19), and the associated changes in environmental impact. Meat consumption was based on disaggregated meat data, from 4 day food diaries that excluded all non-meat components of composite dishes. For each year surveyed, trends for meat intake were reported as mean grams per capita per day and linear-regression models were used to test for trends. We used multivariable linear-regression models to examine differences among consumers, as a percentage of food energy, by gender, ethnicity, equivalised household income, and year of birth. Findings: From 2008 to 2019, average meat consumption per capita per day decreased from 103·7 g (SE 2·3) to 86·3 g (2·9) per day (ptrend<0·0001), including an absolute reduction in red-meat consumption of 13·7 g (ptrend<0·0001), an absolute reduction in processed meat consumption of 7·0 g (ptrend<0·0001), and a 3·2 g increase (ptrend=0·0027) in white-meat consumption. Collectively, these changes were associated with a significant reduction in all six environmental indicators over the whole period. The two middle birth-year groups (people born in 1960–79 and 1980–99) and White individuals were the highest meat consumers. Meat intake increased over time among people born after 1999, was unchanged among Asian and Asian British populations, and decreased in all other population subgroups. We found no difference in intake with gender or household income. Interpretation: Despite the overall reduction in meat intake, reaching meat-consumption targets that align with sustainable diets will require a substantial acceleration of this trend.

	It remains unknown what students from medical schools in the Philippines, such as the School of Medicine at Saint Louis University in the Cordilleras, know and feel about climate change, an important issue in this ecological region of the country.
	Objective
	To determine the knowledge and attitudes of future physicians towards climate change.
	Methods
	Pre-pandemic, we conducted a paper survey among first and second year medical students, adapting questionnaires from previous studies: (1) Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication; and (2) Attitudes about Global Warming based on the 4th Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A pretest was done to ensure respondents’ understanding of the questions. Sample size was computed at 176, and random sampling was done.
	Results
	We obtained a 100% response rate. The respondents were mostly females, <23 years old, in the first year of medical school, and had graduated from Nursing. The majority had fair (score: 20–39%) to good (score: 40–59%) knowledge of climate change. The respondents generally showed favorable attitudes (mean score: 3.76 out of 5.00) towards the issue, indicating they may be more likely to express willingness to take action.

Training future healthcare sustainability leaders: Lessons learned from a Canadian-wide medical student community of practice,/articles/training-future-healthcare-sustainability-leaders-lessons-learned-canadian-wide-medical,"Training future healthcare sustainability leaders in Canada.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"Healthcare systems are significant contributors to the climate crisis and thus, healthcare must transform to reduce its emissions. However, future physicians are underprepared to lead initiatives to reduce healthcare emissions and to transition to low-carbon models of healthcare provision. Project Green Healthcare/Projet Vert la Santé (PGH/PVLS) is a community of practice of seven Canadian medical student teams leading sustainability-oriented projects in their local healthcare systems and medical schools. The nine month progress reports that participating teams submitted were analyzed to characterize network growth and impact, as well as to identify the facilitators of medical student-led healthcare sustainability projects and the learning outcomes of PGH/PVLS participants. In nine months, the PGH/PVLS network of medical students and their health sector collaborators grew 129%, from 45 to 103 individuals involved. Medical student teams described facilitators to their healthcare sustainability projects that were summarized into five themes: 1) working with motivated team members and healthcare sector allies, 2) establishing a successful team environment, 3) receiving support to navigate a complex healthcare system, 4) taking a structured quality improvement approach, and 5) being a part of a community of practice. Learning skills to become environmentally-conscious healthcare providers and appreciating the need for top-down systems-level advocacy were identified as key learning outcomes from the PGH/PVLS program. Developing communities of practice for medical students to engage in healthcare sustainability projects represents an opportunity to achieve net-zero healthcare by preparing future physicians to practice environmentally-conscious healthcare, and by empowering them to become healthcare sustainability leaders.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"Background
	Climate change has direct impacts on human health, and these impacts are projected to grow. The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has implemented climate and health activities for more than a decade. CDC's Climate and Health Program, within NCEH, is the national leader in preparing communities for the health impacts of climate change. Recent efforts by NCEH's Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice (DEHSP) seek to expand climate work, foster collaboration, and create an updated strategy to protect human health from the impacts of climate change.
	Objectives
	Here we outline a proposed strategy focusing on climate and health data, science, and action. The strategy expands NCEH's current climate and health activities while integrating with other programs and partners, to increase capacity across the nation to prepare for and respond to the health impacts of climate change.
	Methods
	DEHSP developed a climate and health strategy through a planning process including division leadership, all branch chiefs within the division, and subject matter experts from across NCEH. The process began in January 2021 and is ongoing to continue to refine an adaptive and iterative strategy. This strategy, while led by DEHSP, aligns with NCEH and CDC's overall climate and health priorities and goals.
	Discussion
	Implementation of this strategy will ensure coordination of CDC climate and health activities to create healthy climate resilient communities, while building local capacity to implement adaptations to protect health. Expanding collaborations and partnerships to support each strategy will be critical for success. The three-pronged strategy serves to increase our understanding of the impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies, foster locally led response actions, and ensure accurate data to inform, track, and evaluate these actions. Government entities at all levels (from local to federal) can consider adopting similar strategies to ensure a coordinated and integrated effort.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Background
	Despite scientific consensus about the risks of climate change on human health, patients´ knowledge on climate change related health risks is largely unexplored. The current study aimed to investigate the current state of climate-specific healthy literacy in patients and the impact of climate-specific medical advice on patients’ behavior regarding health co-benefits.
	Methods
	In December 2020 and January 2021, a total of 449 questionnaires comprising 23 items were completed by patients of general practitioners (GPs) and gynecologists.
	Results
	The majority of general consultations by physicians (86.6% patients from GPs, 84.5% from gynecologists) did not contain any information about climate change or planetary health. Results indicated that climate change is regarded as a global health threat (84.3%) rather than a concern for patients´ own health (66.4%). Patients who received climate-specific medical advice by their physician showed higher knowledge about and awareness of climate change related health risks (p=0.002) as well as emotional concern for their own health (p=0.04) than patients who did not receive advice. Climate-friendly behavior was associated with greater concern about climate change related health-risks (p<.0001).
	Conclusions
	Climate-specific health literacy may play an important role for health co-benefits and climate change mitigation. In order to promote and protect both individual and planetary health, it is crucial to improve the status of climate-specific health literacy.

	The healthcare industry is the second leading contributor of waste in the United States. While there are multiple examples of medical waste audits in the literature, few were conducted in outpatient settings. The objective of this study was to utilize a waste audit to identify key waste generators in an outpatient practice and start immediately reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions.
	Materials and methods
	This was a cross-sectional, observational study wherein waste from a total of 31 randomly selected encounters from December 2020 through June 2021 in the Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Sports and Spine clinics of an academic center was collected and weighed, and key waste generators were identified.
	Results
	The outpatient surgical center produced the most waste per patient encounter (1,758 g), followed by in-clinic procedure visits (379 g per encounter). Clinicians who performed in-clinic procedures using pre-packaged procedure kits produced an estimated 819.5 kg more waste annually than those who selected individual sterile components for their procedures.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Predictive post-hip fracture mortality models have been presented for specific time points (in-hospital, 30-days or 1-year) and most provide marginal predictions based on the patient's risk group. However, the predictive model for individual survival probability following hip fracture is not available. This study aimed to develop a flexible parametric model for predicting individual survival probability for hip fracture patients. In this retrospective study, the medical charts of 765 Thai patients admitted to hospital with a hip fracture resulting from low-impact injury from January 2014 to December 2018 were reviewed. Predictors for all-cause mortality were identified using flexible parametric survival analysis and were used to develop the predictive model. The model was calibrated using a calibration graph and discrimination performance was evaluated using the C-statistic. Internal validity was assessed using bootstrapping. The overall mortality rate of the hip fracture patients was 14%. Predictors significantly associated with survival after hip fracture were age, active malignancy, dementia or Alzheimer's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin concentration, eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73m2 and operative treatments. The model-predicted survival was similar to that actually observed in the very low survival group in the first year after hip fracture. In bootstrapping, the apparent C-statistic and the test C-statistic of the reduced model were 0.79 (95% CI 0.77–0.81) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.78–0.80), respectively.

It found that bioplastics caused less harm and will help policymakers to determine whether bioplastics is beneficial to the environment.
",Goal 13: Climate action,"Throughout their lifecycle, petroleum-based plastics are associated with many environmental problems, including greenhouse gas emissions, persistence in marine and terrestrial environments, pollution, etc. On the other hand, bioplastics form a rapidly growing class of polymeric materials that are commonly presented as alternatives to conventional petroleum-based plastics. However, bioplastics also have been linked to important environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and unfavorable land use change, making it necessary to evaluate the true impact of bioplastic use on the environment. Still, while many reviews discuss bioplastics, few comprehensively and simultaneously address the positives and negatives of bioplastic use for the environment. The primary focus of the present review article is to address this gap in present research. To this end, this review addresses the following questions: (1) what are the different types of bioplastics that are currently in commercial use or under development in the industry; (2) are bioplastics truly good for the environment; and (3) how can we better resolve the controversial impact of bioplastics on the environment? Overall, studies discussed in this review article show that the harms associated with bioplastics are less severe as compared to conventional plastics. Moreover, as new types of bioplastics are developed, it becomes important that future studies conduct thorough life cycle and land use change analyses to confirm the eco-friendliness of these new materials. Such studies will help policymakers to determine whether the use of new-generation bioplastics is indeed beneficial to the environment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Adaption and mitigation strategies already used to prevent or to cope with the destabilization.,Goal 13: Climate action,"In the current context of climate change, high Alpine rock slopes and surface deposits are affected by a series of geomorphological processes whose evolution is partly conditioned by permafrost warming and thawing. This degradation directly impacts infrastructure in high mountain areas (e.g., huts or ropeway transport systems). In this study, we aim to assess the level of risk of destabilization for infrastructure built on permafrost in the French Alps and to discuss the adaptation and mitigation strategies developed by stakeholders. The analysis combines an inventory of the high mountain infrastructure with several data layers - including two recently developed regional maps of permafrost - analysed within a Geographic Information System. We update a destabilization risk index previously developed to identify and rank infrastructure at risk with a hazard characterisation and a vulnerability diagnosis, based on newly available data. The most at-risk infrastructure according to this new risk index are compared with the strategies implemented by the stakeholders to adapt the foundation, reinforce the ground, reduce heat transfer in depth, or monitor the evolution of the ground. Most of the strategies used on the most at-risk cases are reactive to repair the infrastructure after a destabilization.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, the practical measures required for the transition are the subject of heated discussion. Consensus on the goal, dissent on the pathway is how the situation can be summarized. This opinion article aims to bring engineering sciences into the centre of the discussion.

Interviews were conducted with eighteen physicians working across the US and representing different medical specialties. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. We found that most physicians felt such conversations should become part of clinical encounters, primarily to help patients protect their health. However, it was also highlighted that physicians might have objections, referring to the risk of creating feelings of fear or powerlessness and of undermining the physician-patient relationship. This study highlighted that such conversations therefore need to be relevant and actionable, for which timing and communication style are essential. Major barriers for such conversations include a lack of knowledge, conversation skills and guidance, lack of time, and physicians’ perspectives on their role in realizing good quality care. Building on these explorative findings, our tentative conclusion is that discussing the health effects of global environmental change during clinical encounters can become part of physicians’ roles, but that this requires competence development and fundamental changes in the operation of healthcare systems.

Despite the popular use of MHUs in humanitarian emergencies, few guidelines are available for their design and implementation with notably limited gender considerations. This study, therefore, aimed to elucidate the process of designing and implementing MHUs within humanitarian contexts by identifying and reviewing existing guidelines, describing how MHUs were mobilised within NW Syria, including key challenges identified and highlighting areas where gender considerations are necessary to improve service delivery. A holistic, single-case study was used with MHU as the unit of analysis. Existing MHU guidelines were identified and systematically compared to extract their key components, complemented by qualitative interviews with key informants responsible for MHU mobilisation in NW Syria. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. Study findings suggest that MHU deployment is best described as a cyclical process spanning the phases of pre-deployment, design, implementation, and feedback, with the latter central to inform service delivery across all previous phases. Factoring impacting MHU mobilisation in NW Syria were discrepancies in supply and demand, varying acceptability of MHUs, and tensions between stakeholders. Areas for gender considerations in MHU mobilisation include clinic design, staff recruitment, services offered, accessibility, needs assessments, and travel routes.

In particular, Ituna/Itatá IL, in the state of Pará, restricted to the study of Igarapé Ipiaçava isolated indigenous people, has experienced a 654% deforestation rate increase during the same period. The mainstream deforestation analysis explains it as a struggle between conservation and development, which is commonly typified by large-scale producers who replace natural vegetation with pasturelands and crop fields, especially in agricultural frontiers, as ILs are barriers for protecting forests. In this work, we expose a devised and underlying deforestation process in Ituna/Itatá, and argue that land grabbers and squatters have promoted this boom by moving in, clearing, subdividing, and occupying this IL as if it were real estate. Such process mischaracterizes it and obstructs the demarcation process, in the expectation of a land regularization law that authenticates selling the land in the future. This process seems to be promoted by the Brazilian Federal Government rhetoric and mediated by local politicians, somewhat passing on the message of feeble repression against invasions of public lands.

The effect of feed concentration of viruses on the ultrafiltration efficiency has been assessed. For the three viruses, low retentions about 1 log were observed at the lowest concentrations. At higher concentrations, an increase of removal up to 3.0 log for CV-B5 and MS2 phage and 3.5 log for ADV 41 was observed. These results highlight the potential overestimation of UF efficiency during laboratory experiments realized at high concentrations, compared to low concentrations found in environmental resources used for drinking water production. Virus removals with Evian water and real groundwater were compared and groundwater achieved similar or slightly higher removals for the three viruses. Finally, impact of membrane ageing after chlorine exposure was checked.

Moreover, increase of mitochondrial cholesterol (mchol) content and impaired mitochondrial function and GSH depletion contribute to NPC disease. However, the underlying mechanism of mchol accumulation in NPC disease remains unknown.

Liver and brain of Npc1−/− mice presented a significant increase in mchol levels and STARD1 expression. U18666A, an amphiphilic sterol that inhibits lysosomal cholesterol efflux, increased mchol levels in hepatocytes from Stard1f/f mice but not Stard1ΔHep mice. We dissociate the induction of STARD1 expression from endoplasmic reticulum stress, and establish an inverse relationship between ACDase and STARD1 expression and LRH-1 levels. Hepatocytes from Npc1+/+ mice treated with U18666A exhibited increased mchol accumulation, STARD1 upregulation and decreased ACDase expression, effects that were reversed by cholesterol extraction with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. Moreover, transfection of fibroblasts from NPC patients with ACDase, decreased STARD1 expression and mchol accumulation, resulting in increased mitochondrial GSH levels, improved mitochondrial functional performance, decreased oxidative stress and protected NPC fibroblasts against oxidative stress-mediated cell death. Our results demonstrate a cholesterol-dependent inverse relationship between ACDase and STARD1 and provide a novel approach to target the accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondria in NPC disease.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Reversing pathology in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease by hacking cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis with advanced cancer therapeutics,/articles/reversing-pathology-preclinical-model-alzheimers-disease-hacking-cerebrovascular,"An article on the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the potential use of an anti-cancer drug to modulate cerebrovascular angiogenesis as an alternative therapeutic strategy.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Cognitive decline leading to dementia, accompanied by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in neuritic plaques together with the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (tau), are previously noted hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously discovered hypervascularity in brain specimens from AD patients and consistent with this observation, we demonstrated that overexpression of Aβ drives cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis leading to hypervascularity and coincident tight-junction disruption and blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness in animal models of AD. We subsequently demonstrated that amyloid plaque burden and cerebrovascular pathogenesis subside when pro-angiogenic Aβ levels are reduced. Based on these data, we propose a paradigm of AD etiology where, as a compensatory response to impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), Aβ triggers pathogenic cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis that underlies the conventional hallmarks of AD. Consequently, here we present evidence that repurposing anti-cancer drugs to modulate cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis, rather than directly targeting the amyloid cascade, may provide an effective treatment for AD and related vascular diseases of the brain. Methods: We explored whether the anti-cancer drug, Axitinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) can inhibit aberrant cerebrovascular neoangiogenic changes, reduce Aβ deposits and reverse cognitive decline in an animal model of AD. One month post-treatment with Axitinib, we employed a battery of tests to assess cognition and memory in aged Tg2576 AD mice and used molecular analysis to demonstrate reduction of amyloid plaques, BBB leakage, hypervascularity and associated disease pathology. Findings: Targeting the pro-angiogenic pathway in AD using the cancer drug, Axitinib, dramatically reduced cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis, restored BBB integrity, resolved tight-junction pathogenesis, diminishes Aβ depositions in plaques and effectively restores memory and cognitive performance in a preclinical mouse model of AD. Interpretation: Modulation of neoangiogenesis, in an analogous approach to those used to treat aberrant vascularization in cancer and also in the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for intervention in AD that warrants clinical investigation.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The review is intended to be a basic and encyclopedic short insight into metals in AD and discusses the advances in chelation strategies and developments adopted in the treatment of the disease.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of cognitive impairment and dementia worldwide. The pathobiology of the disease has been studied in the form of several hypotheses, ranging from oxidative stress, amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, accumulation of tau forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) through metal dysregulation and homeostasis, dysfunction of the cholinergic system, and to inflammatory and autophagic mechanism. However, none of these hypotheses has led to confirmed diagnostics or approved cure for the disease. Objective: This review is aimed as a basic and an encyclopedic short course into metals in AD and discusses the advances in chelation strategies and developments adopted in the treatment of the disease. Since there is accumulating evidence of the role of both biometal dyshomeostasis (iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn)) and metal-amyloid interactions that lead to the pathogenesis of AD, this review focuses on unraveling therapeutic chelation strategies that have been considered in the treatment of the disease, aiming to sequester free and protein-bound metal ions and reducing cerebral metal burden. Promising compounds possessing chemically modified moieties evolving as multi-target ligands used as anti-AD drug candidates are also covered. Results and Conclusion: Several multidirectional and multifaceted studies on metal chelation therapeutics show the need for improved synthesis, screening, and analysis of compounds to be able to effectively present chelating anti-AD drugs. Most drug candidates studied have limitations in their physicochemical properties; some enhance redistribution of metal ions, while others indirectly activate signaling pathways in AD. The metal chelation process in vivo still needs to be established and the design of potential anti-AD compounds that bi-functionally sequester metal ions as well as inhibit the Aβ aggregation by competing with the metal ions and reducing metal-induced oxidative damage and neurotoxicity may signal a bright end in chelation-based therapeutics of AD.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Furthermore, the results further implicate Reelin’s importance in both HF homeostasis and AD pathogenesis.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"The hippocampal formation (HF) is a neuroanatomical region essential for learning and memory. As one of the earliest regions to display the histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), determining the specific mechanisms of the HF's vulnerability is of capital importance. Reelin, a glycoprotein crucial in cortical lamination during embryonic neurogenesis, has an uncommon expression pattern within the HF and has been implicated in both learning and AD pathogenesis. We hypothesized that Reelin deficiency would expedite behavioral impairments which accompany normal aging. Additionally, we hypothesized that Reelin deficiency in the presence of mutated human microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) would further impair hippocampal function. To test our hypothesis, we utilized cohorts of aged mice, aged mice with Reelin conditional knockout (RcKO), and adult mice with both RcKO and MAPT in the Barnes maze and Trace fear conditioning. Consistent with prior literature, increased age in wild-type mice was sufficient to reduce spatial searching in the Barnes maze. Increased age both exacerbated spatial impairments and altered context learning in RcKO mice. Lastly, adult mice with both RcKO and the MAPT transgene displayed both the lowest age-of-onset and most severe spatial learning deficits. In conclusion, Reelin deficiency when combined with AD risk-factors produced consistent impairments in spatial memory tasks.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Wind energy development receives broad support but is often opposed at the local level due to nuisance concerns and uncertainties about how it affects the landowners living due to the turbines and the broader community. Local opposition to wind energy development can be a powerful force slowing or even ending its implementation in a given region. Oklahoma, USA is currently ranked as 4th in the United States in current wind energy production and has seen significant pushback from some local communities as a renewable energy resource. Previous studies have examined wind energy development's impact on rural education income, and property values of different communities in Oklahoma. However, funding information on how wind energy development affects the individuals living alongside the turbines are limited. Using fifteen interviews with landowners, site-managers, community representatives, and pro-wind non-profit organization representatives, this study finds that individuals who live in proximity to wind energy development, particularly those involved in the agricultural industry, have created novel and unique uses for wind farm infrastructure.

We then look at needed uranium resources. The most important result of the present work is that the contribution of nuclear power to mitigate climate change is, and will be, very limited. At present nuclear power avoids annually 2–3% of total global GHG emissions. Looking at announced plans for new nuclear builds and lifetime extensions this value would decrease even further until 2040. Furthermore, a substantial expansion of nuclear power will not be possible because of technical obstacles and limited resources. Limited uranium-235 supply inhibits substantial expansion scenarios with the current nuclear technology. New nuclear technologies, making use of uranium-238, will not be available in time.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Water is essential for the life, but many people lack the accessibility to clean and healthy drinking water and die as a consequence of water-borne infections. Microorganism-mediated water pollution is considered as one of the great concerns to the aquatic environment across the globe. The effluent of fecal matter, hospitals, industry, and cattle farms increase the bacterial load in a water body. Coliform groups of bacteria have long been typically applied as an indicator organism of microbial contamination of the water and historically led to the public health security perception. Among the coliform, Escherichia coli is the indicator of fecal contamination. The multiple tube fermentation technique has been applied as a conventional way to detect coliform in water samples through the fermentation of lactose sugar with production of acid and gas. The potability of water has been measured by the absence or presence of coliform bacteria within the permissible limit referencing the most probable number index value (MPN/100 ml). As fecal pollution indicators, fecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens are widely used as an alternative to coliform bacteria and have been confirmed via esculin hydrolyzing or catalase-negativity and sulfite reduction tests. Molecular (PCR-based) and enzymatic methods have been applied as a rapid way to detect indicators and other enteric isolates in water samples. Apart from that standard plate count (SPC) of heterotrophic bacteria and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) techniques also determine the bacterial and organic pollution load in a water sample. Therefore, bacteriological analysis of water indicated that water is polluted by sewage to the extent that it is unsuitable for drinking and also unsuitable for recreation purposes. This is one of the big problems in the twenty-first century is providing everybody with safe drinking or domestic water.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Many South-African towns in the Western Cape Province are dependent on surface water resources to satisfy the ever-increasing water demand. In recent years, the effects of climate change on the environment has challenged these areas continually and recently led to calls for major changes in water management. The Lower Olifants River Water Management Area experienced an extreme drought that persisted from 2016 to 2018, which led to the need for development of groundwater resources. The local economy of the Lower Olifants River is dependent on water releases from the Clanwilliam and Bulshoek Dams, located within the Olifants River Syncline (ORS), where ‘megafault’ zones form preferred flowpaths for groundwater in the Table Mountain Group (TMG) aquifers. The Lower Olifants River Water User Association (LORWUA) was mandated to proceed with the exploration and development of these aquifers to supplement the existing water use of the LORWUA. This will be available during periods of less rainfall and therefore increase the security of the water supplied. The groundwater project aimed at exploring and developing the fractured rock aquifers of the Peninsula (Op) and Skurweberg (Ss) Formations contained within the TMG. Through a high-level desktop assessment, remote sensing investigations and geophysical ground surveys, several target areas and drilling priorities were identified to obtain high borehole yields that access the resource in proximity to existing surface infrastructure. The projected water need from the groundwater resource was 8.6 million cubic metres per annum (Mm3/a). Faults/structure zones were the main hydrogeological targets, with drill target depths of structures planned for intersection deeper than 100 m below ground level (mbgl). Down-hole camera work and initial aquifer testing concluded that deep geological contact zones are prone to collapse when flow is induced in water-bearing fractures. This indicated the need for production borehole construction, even prior to aquifer testing for yield estimates. A major concern still to be resolved is the availability of water in storage and the realistic expectations of the well field over time. Although individual borehole testing provided information on the properties of specific water-bearing structures, long-term monitoring will provide a better understanding of the aquifer in response to abstraction and recovery in times of rest. The operating rules for the conjunctive use of the well field developed, with the existing surface water scheme, is still to be defined and modelled for optimisation, pending long-term monitoring.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Spirometric lung function impairment is an independent predictor of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and mortality across a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds and environmental settings. No contemporary studies have explored these relationships in a predominantly regional/remote First Nations population, whose health outcomes are worse than for non-First Nations populations, and First Nations people living in urban centres. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1,734 adults (1,113 First Nations) referred to specialist respiratory outreach clinics in the state of Queensland, Australia from February 2012 to March 2020. Regression modelling was used to test associations between lung function and mortality and cardiovascular disease. Findings: At the time of analysis (August 2020), 189 patients had died: 88 (47%) from respiratory causes and 38 (20%) from cardiovascular causes. When compared to patients with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) Z-scores of >0 to -1, patients with Z-scores <-1 were at elevated mortality risk (HR=3•2, 95%CI 1•4-7•4; HR=2•6, 95%CI 1•3-5•1), and elevated cardiovascular disease risk (OR=1•5, 95%CI 1•1-2•2; OR=1•6, 95%CI 1•2-2•3). FEV1/FVC% Z-scores <-1 were associated with increased overall mortality (HR=1•6, 95%CI 1•1-2•3), but not cardiovascular disease (OR=1•1, 95%CI 0•8-1•4). These associations were not affected by First Nations status. Interpretation: Reduced lung function even within the clinically normal range is associated with increased mortality, and cardiovascular disease in First Nations Australians.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Twelve potentially modifiable risk factors (less education, hypertension, obesity, alcohol, traumatic brain injury (TBI), hearing loss, smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, air pollution) account for an estimated 40% of worldwide dementia cases. We aimed to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for dementia for the four largest New Zealand ethnic groups (European, Māori, Asian, and Pacific peoples) to identify whether optimal dementia prevention targets differed by ethnicity. Methods: We calculated risk factor prevalence for 10 risk factors using the New Zealand Health Survey 2018/19 and published reports for hearing loss and TBI prevalences. We calculated the PAF for each risk factor using calculated prevalence and relative risk estimates from previous meta-analyses. To account for risk factor overlap, we calculated communality of risk factors and a weighted PAF. Findings: The weighted PAF for dementia was 47•7% overall in New Zealand, 47•6% for Europeans, 51•4% for Māori, 50•8% for Pacific peoples, and 40•8% for Asians. Highest PAFs for Europeans were hearing loss (8%) and social isolation (5•7%), and for Asians hearing loss (7•3%) and physical inactivity (5•5%). For Māori and Pacific peoples, highest PAFs were for obesity (7•3% and 8•9% respectively) and hearing loss (6•5% and 6•6%). Interpretation: New Zealand has higher dementia prevention potential than worldwide estimates with high prevalences of untreated hearing loss and obesity.

Methods: We utilized a cross-sectional study of 646 PLWH from the Florida Cohort study's baseline survey. Our analysis included chi-squared tests and logistic regression. Results: Participants that were 55 years old or above had more than twice the odds of reporting a past HCV test than those 18–34 years old (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.22–5.0), which contrasted with Non-Hispanic Blacks who had lower odds of reporting a past HCV test than non-Hispanic Whites (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35–1.1). Drug use was also associated with higher odds of reporting a past HCV test for injection drugs (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.0–8.43) and non-injection drugs (OR 1.52 CI 0.99–2.21). Individuals with education beyond high school had higher odds of reporting a past HCV test than those that did not attend/complete high school (OR 1.9 CI 1.11–3.16). Conclusion: Our findings highlight the success of the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's campaign in groups at high risk of HCV, such as baby boomers and Injection Drug Users (IDUs). However, they also reflect the current low HCV testing in PLWH that are 18–34 years old, have a low level of education, and are non-Hispanic Black. Our findings are of crucial public health significance because untreated HCV in PLWH is a major cause of severe liver disease and death.

A novel approach is to construct new ecosystems to improve the functioning of degraded landscapes. However, the development of novel ecosystems is largely driven by the pre-construction hydrogeophysical and ecological conditions of the soil. In Lake Markermeer, a deteriorating freshwater lake in the Netherlands, a large archipelago is currently being constructed to boost the ecological functioning of the lake. Hence, islands – with wetlands and with more elevated and dryer areas – have been created to sustain biodiversity and key biogeochemical functions such as nutrient cycling. The islands are constructed from lake-bottom sediments. To study how two potentially important drivers, water level and bioturbation, affect soil characteristics in a novel wetland ecosystem, we experimentally tested the effects of water level (-30, -10 and 5 cm), and bioturbation by earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) and Tubifex spp. in a microcosm experiment. We demonstrate that a high water level prevents soil subsidence, soil crack formation and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and affects nitrogen cycling. In dryer soils, the presence of earthworms strongly increases CO2 emissions next to reducing soil crack formation, while Tubifex spp. in wetter soils hardly affect soil characteristics.

Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with caregivers and their children 6-59 mo of age with SAM admitted to the Moyo NRU in Blantyre, Malawi. The primary outcome of the trial was child development according to Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) composite z-scores of gross motor, fine motor, language, and social domains. A qualitative component with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews was also completed with a subset of caregivers who participated in the trial. Results: Sixty-eight caregivers and children were enrolled to clusters by week and randomly assigned to the comparison arm and 104 to the intervention arm. There were no differences in child development, with mean MDAT composite z-scores in the comparison arm of -1.2 (95% CI: -2.1, -0.22) and in the intervention arm of -1.1 (95% CI: -1.9, -0.40) (P = 0.93). The qualitative evaluation with 20 caregivers indicated that the 3 modules of the Kusamala Program were appropriate and that they applied many of the lessons learned at home as much as possible. Conclusions: The Kusamala Program did not result in improved developmental or nutritional outcomes, yet it was viewed positively by caregivers according to qualitative results. Future research should evaluate more intensive interventions for caregivers and children with SAM.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"As dementia becomes more prevalent in the aging population, clinicians increasingly face the challenge of caring for patients who had told family members that they preferred death to life with advanced dementia. Advance directives can guide management, but usually are inadequate in caring for patients with advanced dementia. The “now” patient has very different sensibilities than the “then” patient who had expressed preferences for terminal care before dementia severely impaired cognition and executive function. Clinicians lack clear means of following a patient's directive to die rather than to live with advanced dementia. Withholding life-sustaining oral feeding or fluids is ethically problematic.

Blood cholesterol and risk of dementia in more than 1·8 million people over two decades: a retrospective cohort study,/articles/blood-cholesterol-and-risk-dementia-more-1%C2%B78-million-people-over-two-decades-retrospective,"An article on dementia risk factors, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the association between blood lipid levels and dementia.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Uncertainty remains concerning the association of blood cholesterol with the risk of subsequent dementia. Using data from people with lipid measurements in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we examined the association between blood lipid levels and dementia (both vascular and non-vascular, including Alzheimer's disease) by age at first measurement of blood lipids and duration of follow-up. Methods: We studied a cohort from the UK CPRD of people aged 40 years or older with a first total cholesterol recording between Jan 1, 1992, and Dec 31, 2009. Follow-up was until the first record of dementia, the last data collection date, patient death or transfer out of the practice, or Jan 5, 2015, whichever was earliest. We excluded individuals with a record of dementia before the total cholesterol measurement. We used Poisson regression to examine the association between baseline total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides and incident dementia diagnosis. Analyses were stratified by age at first measurement (<65 years or ≥65 years) and duration of follow-up (<10 years or ≥10 years). Our primary focus was LDL cholesterol. We adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, country within the UK, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol, body-mass index, comorbidities, and prescriptions. Findings: 1 853 954 people had a first total cholesterol recording (dementia diagnosis in 49 416 [2·7%] people), including 953 635 [51·4%] people with LDL cholesterol values for analysis (dementia diagnosis in 21 602 [2·3%] people). Overall, we found a modest positive association between LDL cholesterol and dementia, with an adjusted rate ratio (RR) of 1·05 (95% CI 1·03–1·06) per SD increase in LDL cholesterol (1·01 mmol/L or 39 mg/dL increase). Adjusted RRs per 1-SD increase in LDL cholesterol in people younger than 65 years at baseline (n=636 262) were 1·10 (95% 1·04–1·15) for dementia diagnosed in the first 10 years after measurement and 1·17 (1·08–1·27) for dementia diagnosed more than 10 years after measurement. Associations for LDL cholesterol in people aged 65 years or older at baseline (n=317 373) were weaker compared with people younger than 65 years (RR 1·03 [95% CI 1·01–1·05] for dementia diagnosed during the first 10 years of follow-up and 1·07 [1·03–1·13] for dementia diagnosed after 10 years). We observed a weaker association between total cholesterol and dementia incidence and no consistent associations for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Interpretation: LDL cholesterol measured in mid-life (<65 years) is modestly associated with dementia risk more than 10 years later. LDL cholesterol should be added to the list of modifiable risk factors for dementia. Funding: The Alzheimer's Society.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
The burden of neurological disorders across the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2019,/articles/burden-neurological-disorders-across-states-india-global-burden-disease-study-1990-2019,"An article in support of SDG 3, estimating that 3.69 million people had Alzheimer's disease or other dementias in India in 2019, with prevalence rapidly increasing in those older than 60 years.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"BACKGROUND: A systematic understanding of the burden of neurological disorders at the subnational level is not readily available for India. We present a comprehensive analysis of the disease burden and trends of neurological disorders at the state level in India. METHODS: Using all accessible data from multiple sources, we estimated the prevalence or incidence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for neurological disorders from 1990 to 2019 for all states of India as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019. We assessed the contribution of each neurological disorder to deaths and DALYs in India in 2019, their trends in prevalence or incidence and DALY rates over time, and heterogeneity between the states of India. We also assessed the Pearson correlation coefficient between Socio-demographic Index (SDI) of the states and the prevalence or incidence and DALY rates of each neurological disorder. Additionally, we estimated the contribution of known risk factors to DALYs from neurological disorders. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the mean estimates. FINDINGS: The contribution of non-communicable neurological disorders to total DALYs in India doubled from 4·0% (95% UI 3·2-5·0) in 1990 to 8·2% (6·6-10·2) in 2019, and the contribution of injury-related neurological disorders increased from 0·2% (0·2-0·3) to 0·6% (0·5-0·7). Conversely, the contribution of communicable neurological disorders decreased from 4·1% (3·5-4·8) to 1·1% (0·9-1·5) during the same period. In 2019, the largest contributors to the total neurological disorder DALYs in India were stroke (37·9% [29·9-46·1]), headache disorders (17·5% [3·6-32·5]), epilepsy (11·3% [9·0-14·3]), cerebral palsy (5·7% [4·2-7·7]), and encephalitis (5·3% [3·7-8·9]). The crude DALY rate of several neurological disorders had considerable heterogeneity between the states in 2019, with the highest variation for tetanus (93·2 times), meningitis (8·3 times), and stroke (5·5 times). SDI of the states had a moderate significant negative correlation with communicable neurological disorder DALY rate and a moderate significant positive correlation with injury-related neurological disorder DALY rate in 2019. For most of the non-communicable neurological disorders, there was an increase in prevalence or incidence from 1990 to 2019. Substantial decreases were evident in the incidence and DALY rates of communicable neurological disorders during the same period. Migraine and multiple sclerosis were more prevalent among females than males and traumatic brain injuries were more common among males than females in 2019. Communicable diseases contributed to the majority of total neurological disorder DALYs in children younger than 5 years, and non-communicable neurological disorders were the highest contributor in all other age groups. In 2019, the leading risk factors contributing to DALYs due to non-communicable neurological disorders in India included high systolic blood pressure, air pollution, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. For communicable disorders, the identified risk factors with modest contributions to DALYs were low birthweight and short gestation and air pollution. INTERPRETATION: The increasing contribution of non-communicable and injury-related neurological disorders to the overall disease burden in India, and the substantial state-level variation in the burden of many neurological disorders highlight the need for state-specific health system responses to address the gaps in neurology services related to awareness, early identification, treatment, and rehabilitation.

We aimed to evaluate the quality and outcomes of in-hospital ACS management for White patients vs patients of colour, within a universal healthcare context. Methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of the Acute Myocardial Infarction - Knowledge Translation to Optimize Adherence to Evidence-Based Therapy study, a cluster-randomized trial evaluating a knowledge-translation intervention at 24 hospitals in Quebec, Canada (years: 2009 and 2012). The primary endpoint was coronary catheterization. The secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality, percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularization, major bleeding, total stroke, and discharge prescription of evidence-based medical therapy. Results: Of 3444 included patients, 2738 were White, and 706 were people of colour. The mean age was 68.2 years (33.3% women) among White patients and 69.5 years (36.0% women) among patients of colour. Patients of colour were less likely to undergo in-hospital coronary catheterization than were White patients (74.5% vs 80.3%, P = 0.001). This difference was attenuated after adjusting for patient-level characteristics (odds ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.09), and it was eliminated after adjusting for hospital-level characteristics (odds ratio 1.04; 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.49). Conclusions: Racial disparity in coronary catheterization for ACS persists within a universal healthcare context. Patients’ comorbidities and hospital-level factors may be partially responsible for this inequality. Future research on cardiovascular healthcare in patients with diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds in universal healthcare systems is needed to remediate racial inequality in ACS management.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis: scaling up for impact now and in the future,/articles/hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-scaling-impact-now-and-future,"This Viewpoint supports SDG 3 by exploring the reasons behind inadequate PrEP uptake to date and offering considerations for effective scale up to meet 2030 UNAIDS targets.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"More than a decade after the first efficacy evidence for oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was reported, PrEP uptake globally has been inadequate and global HIV prevention targets have been missed. Access to PrEP is still highly concentrated in a fairly small number of countries and, even within countries with widespread PrEP access, inequalities have emerged. More ambitious, high-priority global targets for PrEP uptake are required and could accelerate the HIV prevention response in a similar way to the success of the 90-90-90 testing and treatment targets. Health systems must be PrEP-friendly and allow PrEP to be prescribed in settings already attended by large numbers of HIV-negative individuals who are at risk. Several models have been advanced for the greater demedicalisation of PrEP. Individual-level barriers to PrEP uptake and persistence have been characterised, such as low awareness, low willingness to use PrEP, and the gap between self-perceived and actual HIV risk. Overcoming these barriers will require further efforts to understand and address them first. New PrEP modalities are emerging; as more options become available, we need to develop a greater understanding of the long-term patterns of PrEP use in different populations and to develop models of such use that can accommodate people alternating through periods of use and non-use, as well as switching between dosing regimens or modalities as they become available. Scaling up PrEP is crucial to achieving the UNAIDS prevention targets for 2030. Simply getting more people onto PrEP cannot be the only goal: the big-picture definition of success for PrEP programmes must be their impact on the HIV epidemic.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We present an international analysis of 249 (United States: 140; United Kingdom: 109) patients with HIV-BL treated from 2008 to 2019 aiming to identify prognostic factors and outcomes. With a median follow up of 4.5 years, the 3- year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55% to 67%) and 66% (95%CI 59% to 71%), respectively, with similar results in both countries. Patients with baseline central nervous system (CNS) involvement had shorter 3-year PFS (36%) compared to patients without CNS involvement (69%; P < .001) independent of frontline treatment. The incidence of CNS recurrence at 3 years across all treatments was 11% with a higher incidence observed after dose-adjusted infusional etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide (DA-EPOCH) (subdistribution hazard ratio: 2.52; P = .03 vs other regimens) without difference by CD4 count 100/mm3.

And gasoline and diesel fuels will remain as the main energy sources for motor vehicles. After reviewing the latest advantages and disadvantages of AFVs, including flexible-fuel, gas, electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell electric vehicles, it is found that the higher price of AFVs, compared to that of gasoline and diesel vehicles, might be one of the main barriers for their wider adoption. But on the other hand, there is the “chicken and egg” problem. Because people mostly do not select AFVs due to their higher price and sometimes their less infrastructure availability compared to those of gasoline and diesel vehicles, however, governments and AFVs manufacturers claim that the insignificant demand volume and less interest by people to purchase them, is one of the main reasons for a higher price and less infrastructure availability of AFVs. So, what should we do for adopting AFVs? This review shows that there are two very important and fundamental points that might cause a rise in the demand and usage of AFVs, rather than waiting for the reduction in AFVs prices. Those points are car salespeople's and people's knowledge about AFVs and the environmental issues, and their encouragement to accept and use AFVs. Although the AFVs are available on the market for many years, many people around the world have no/less/old/wrong knowledge about the current AFVs. Thus, most of these people reject these vehicles for usage, even when their important parameters such as purchase price, operating cost, driving range, and fuel availability be the same (or close) as those of gasoline or diesel vehicles.

Studies have documented the mental health status of non-indigenous Bangladeshi people, but little attention has been paid during the pandemic to the investigation of the mental health status of indigenous people living in remote hilly areas. To address this gap the present study aimed at investigating the prevalence and accompanying risk factors of depression, anxiety, stress, and compromised well-being among indigenous people during the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 422 indigenous people aged between 16 and 90 using the 21-item Bangla Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (BDASS-21) and the Bangla version of the WHO-5 Well-being Index from January 30 to April 10, 2021.

Socioeconomic deprivation and genetic ancestry interact to modify type 2 diabetes ethnic disparities in the United Kingdom,/articles/socioeconomic-deprivation-and-genetic-ancestry-interact-modify-type-2-diabetes-ethnic,"This study supports SDGs 3 and 10 by investigating the role of genetic ancestry in ethnic disparities in type 2 diabetes, and interactions with socioeconomic deprivation. The effects of environmental risk factors were found to differ among ancestry groups, suggesting the need for group-specific interventions.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex common disease that disproportionately impacts minority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom (UK). Socioeconomic deprivation (SED) is widely considered as a potential explanation for T2D ethnic disparities in the UK, whereas the effect of genetic ancestry (GA) on such disparities has yet to be studied. Methods: We leveraged data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study, with participants enrolled between 2006 and 2010, to model the relationship between SED (Townsend index), GA (clustering principal components of whole genome genotype data), and T2D status (ICD-10 codes) across the three largest ethnic groups in the UK – Asian, Black, and White – using multivariable logistic regression. Findings: The Asian group shows the highest T2D prevalence (17·9%), followed by the Black (11·7%) and White (5·5%) ethnic groups. We find that both SED (OR: 1·11, 95% CI: 1·10–1·11) and non-European GA (OR South Asian versus European: 4·37, 95% CI: 4·10–4·66; OR African versus European: 2·52, 95% CI: 2·23–2·85) are significantly associated with the observed T2D disparities. GA and SED show significant interaction effects on T2D, with SED being a relatively greater risk factor for T2D for individuals with South Asian and African ancestry, compared to those with European ancestry. Interpretation: The significant interactions between SED and GA underscore how the effects of environmental risk factors can differ among ancestry groups, suggesting the need for group-specific interventions.

Structural racism and risk of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy,/articles/structural-racism-and-risk-sars-cov-2-pregnancy,"This Research paper supports SDGs 3 and 10 by characterising racial disparities among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2. The findings showed that Black women were more likely to have occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than White women and that Black women with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy were more likely to have a preterm delivery.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Structural racism leads to adverse health outcomes, as highlighted by inequities in COVID-19 infections. We characterized Black/White disparities among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 in Cuyahoga County which has some of the most extreme health disparities in the U.S., such as a rate of Black infant mortality that is three times that of White counterparts. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using data collected as part of public health surveillance between March 16, 2020 until October 1, 2020. This study aimed to compare Black and Non-Black pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to understand how the distribution of risk factors may differ by race. Outcomes included age, gestational age at infection, medical co-morbidities, exposure history, socio-economic status, occupation, symptom severity and pregnancy complications. Findings: One hundred and sixty-two women were included. 81 (50%) were Black, 67 (41%) White, 9 (0·05%) Hispanic, 2 (0·01%) Asian; and three did not self-identify with any particular race. More than half who supplied occupational information (n = 132) were essential workers as classified by the CDC definition (55%, n = 73). Black women were younger (p = 0·0062) and more likely to identify an occupational contact as exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0·020). Non-Black women were more likely to work from home (p = 0·018) and indicate a personal or household contact as their exposure (p = 0·020). Occupation was a risk factor for severe symptoms (aOR 4·487, p = 0·037). Most Black women lived in areas with median income <$39,000 and Black women were more likely to have a preterm delivery (22·2% versus 0%, p = 0·026). Interpretation: Many pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 are essential workers. Black women are more likely than White counterparts to have occupational exposure as the presumed source for their infection. Limitations in occupational options and controlling risk in these positions could be related to lower socio-economic status, resulting from a long history of structural racism in Cuyahoga County as evidenced by redlining and other policies limiting opportunities for people of color.

PLWD are 16–62% less likely to meet physical activity guidelines and are at higher risk of serious health problems related to inactivity than people without disabilities. Meta-analyses have shown that physical activity has beneficial effects on cardiovascular fitness (average standardised mean difference [SMD] 0·69 [95% CI 0·31–1·01]), musculoskeletal fitness (0·59 [0·31–0·87]), cardiometabolic risk factors (0·39 [0·04–0·75]), and brain and mental health outcomes (0·47 [0·21–0·73]). These meta-analyses also show that health benefits can be achieved even with less than 150 min of physical activity per week, and suggest that some physical activity is better than none. Meta-analyses of interventions to increase physical activity for PLWD have reported effect sizes ranging from SMD 0·29 (95% CI 0·17–0·41, k=10) to 1·00 (0·46–1·53, k=10).

Ethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs for obesity based on type 2 diabetes risk in England: a population-based cohort study,/articles/ethnicity-specific-bmi-cutoffs-obesity-based-type-2-diabetes-risk-england-population-based,"This article supports SGDs 3 and 10 by identifying ethnicity-specific body-mass index cutoffs for obesity based on type 2 diabetes risk-equivalence to the cutoff in White populations. The findings suggest ethnicity-specific body-mass index cutoffs are needed to optimise prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: National and global recommendations for BMI cutoffs to trigger action to prevent obesity-related complications like type 2 diabetes among non-White populations are questionable. We aimed to prospectively identify ethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs for obesity based on the risk of type 2 diabetes that are risk-equivalent to the BMI cutoff for obesity among White populations (≥30 kg/m2). Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we used electronic health records across primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) linked to secondary care records (Hospital Episodes Statistics) from a network of general practitioner practices in England. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, without any past or current diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, had a BMI of 15·0–50·0 kg/m2 and complete ethnicity data, were registered with a general practitioner practice in England at any point between Sept 1, 1990, and Dec 1, 2018, and had at least 1 year of follow-up data. Patients with type 2 diabetes were identified by use of a CALIBER phenotyping algorithm. Self-reported ethnicity was collapsed into five main categories. Age-adjusted and sex-adjusted negative binomial regression models, with fractional polynomials for BMI, were fitted with incident type 2 diabetes and ethnicity data. Findings: 1 472 819 people were included in our study, of whom 1 333 816 (90·6%) were White, 75 956 (5·2%) were south Asian, 49 349 (3·4%) were Black, 10 934 (0·7%) were Chinese, and 2764 (0·2%) were Arab. After a median follow-up of 6·5 years (IQR 3·2–11·2), 97 823 (6·6%) of 1 472 819 individuals were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. For the equivalent age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes at a BMI of 30·0 kg/m2 in White populations, the BMI cutoffs were 23·9 kg/m2 (95% CI 23·6–24·0) in south Asian populations, 28·1 kg/m2 (28·0–28·4) in Black populations, 26·9 kg/m2 (26·7–27·2) in Chinese populations, and 26·6 kg/m2 (26·5–27·0) in Arab populations.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Disparities in involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation between population subgroups have been identified in adults, but little is known about the factors associated with involuntary hospitalisation in children or adolescents. We did a systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to investigate the social and clinical factors associated with involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation among children and adolescents. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies of any type up to July 22, 2020, that compared the characteristics of voluntary and involuntary psychiatric inpatients (mean age of sample ≤18 years). We synthesised results using random effects meta-analysis on unadjusted data and by narrative synthesis. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated using I2. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42020099892. Findings: 23 studies from 11 countries were included in the systematic review and narrative synthesis, of which 19 studies (n=31 212) were included in the meta-analysis. On meta-analysis, involuntary rather than voluntary hospitalisation of minors was associated with a diagnosis of psychosis (eight studies; odds ratio 3·63, 95% CI 2·43–5·44, p<0·0001), substance misuse (five studies; 1·87, 1·05–3·30, p=0·032), or intellectual disability (four studies; 3·33, 1·33–8·34, p=0·010), as well as presenting with a perceived risk of harm to self (eight studies; 2·05, 1·15–3·64, p=0·015) or to others (five studies; 2·37, 1·39–4·03, p=0·0015). Involuntary hospitalisation was also found to be associated with being aged 12 years or older (three studies; 3·57, 1·46–8·73, p=0·0052) and being from a Black rather than a White ethnic group (three studies; 2·72, 1·88–3·95, p<0·0001). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity for most factors included in the meta-analysis (I2 from 51·3% to 92·3%). Narrative synthesis found that more severe illness and poorer global functioning was associated with involuntary hospitalisation. Interpretation: Over-representation of involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation in certain groups might begin in childhood, potentially establishing a cycle of inequality that continues into adulthood.

The Role of Targeted Nutrition Education of Preschoolers and Caregivers on Sustained Consumption of Biofortified Orange-Fleshed Sweetpotato in Kenya,/articles/role-targeted-nutrition-education-preschoolers-and-caregivers-sustained-consumption,"The results from this study emphasize the role of targeted and integrated nutrition education approaches in improving OFSP (Orange-Fleshed Sweetpotato) consumption behavior; therefore, it is imperative to focus on increasing the rate of consumption of OFSP over time to ensure sustainable utilization of essential micronutrients. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Persistent prevalence of high malnutrition in poor households in developing countries calls for enhancement of cost-effective nutrition interventions among the vulnerable groups. One responsive way is to promote regular consumption of home-grown biofortified foods, particularly in the micronutrient-deficient groups. Previous nutrition interventions have targeted adults with behavior change education, but have rarely explored the potential of nutrition education of preschoolers as change agents. Objectives: This study sought to assess the effect of nutrition education targeting preschool children and their caregivers on their consumption of vitamin A-biofortified orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) in rural farm households in Homa Bay County, Kenya. Methods: A total of 431 preschooler-caregiver pairs from 15 village-level clusters were recruited into a randomized controlled trial. The sample was randomized into 1 control (3 villages) and 3 treatment groups (4 villages each). Treatments involved channeling nutrition education to preschoolers through their learning materials (preschooler treatment); the caregivers through their mobile phones (caregiver treatment); and to both preschoolers and their caregivers simultaneously (integrated treatment). Baseline and follow-up household-level surveys were conducted with the caregivers, and consumption data were collected from the preschoolers using a child dietary diversity register. Class teachers sought 24-h consumption recalls of the preschoolers for 19 consecutive schooldays. Results: The results of a zero-inflated Poisson regression showed that the phone-mediated and multichanneled nutrition education approaches significantly increased the number of days of OFSP consumption. The integrated nutrition education approach significantly increased the preschoolers' likelihood to consume OFSP, number of OFSP consumption days, and likelihood to consume it more than once per week by 11%, 77%, and 20%, respectively. Conclusions: Nutrition education through OFSP-branded preschoolers' learning materials and phone-mediated messages provides effective nudges to the caregivers to feed their preschoolers regularly with OFSP. This could have implications for realizing sustainable nutrition programs in biofortified crop-growing areas.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 2: Zero hunger,"Background: The use of grains as an alternative to wheat in breadmaking has rapidly grown in the last few years, driven by the Sustainable Development Goals toward improving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture. Flours from legumes, pseudo-cereals, minor cereals and milling by-products, such as bran, are of particular interest. The production of partially substituted or wheat-free bread is, however, a challenging task in terms of texture and flavour attributes. Scope and approach: The present review covers recent advances in the application of dextrans in improving dough rheology, baking performance and bread flavour characteristics. Emphasis has been given to in situ application of dextran via sourdough technology as a ‘clean label’ alternative to commercial hydrocolloid additives. Key findings and conclusions: In-situ dextran production leads to bread with higher specific volume, softer crumbs and increased moisture content. Dextran also provides an anti-staling effect attributable to its ability to reduce water mobility and retard starch retrogradation. A structure–function relationship has suggested that dextran with high molecular weight and less branching is superior in enhancing bread quality. Furthermore, mild acidification favours the functionality of dextran in dough and bread systems, while intensive acidification results in adverse effects. Lactic acid bacterial strains belonging to the genus Weissella exhibiting mild acidification are therefore appreciated in regard to the utilisation of in-situ produced dextran. This review highlights the novel application of dextran as a flavour masking agent to minimise off-flavours (e.g. beany flavour, bitter taste, and aftertaste) originating from non-wheat grains, consequently improving the acceptability of the final products.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Common infections have been associated with dementia risk; however, evidence is scarce. We aimed to investigate the association between common infections and dementia in adults (≥65 years) in a UK population-based cohort study. Methods: We did a historical cohort study of individuals who were 65 years and older with no history of dementia or cognitive impairment using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between time-updated previous common infections (sepsis, pneumonia, other lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections) and incident dementia diagnosis. We also tested for effect modification by diabetes since it is an independent risk factor for dementia and co-occurs with infection. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018, our study included 989 800 individuals (median age 68·6 years [IQR 65·0–77·0]; 537 602 [54·3%] women) of whom 402 204 (40·6%) were diagnosed with at least one infection and 56 802 (5·7%) had incident dementia during a median follow-up of 5·2 years (IQR 2·3–9·0).

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Studies generally use cognitive assessment done at one timepoint to define cognitive impairment in order to examine conversion to dementia. Our objective was to examine the predictive accuracy and conversion rate of seven alternate definitions of cognitive impairment for dementia. Methods: In this prospective study, we included participants from the Whitehall II cohort study who were assessed for cognitive impairment in 2007–09 and were followed up for clinically diagnosed dementia. Algorithms based on poor cognitive performance (defined using age-specific and sex-specific thresholds, and subsequently thresholds by education or occupation levels) and objective cognitive decline (using data from cognitive assessments in 1997–99, 2002–04, and 2007–09) were used to generate seven alternate definitions of cognitive impairment. We compared predictive accuracy using Royston's R2, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), sensitivity, specificity, and Harrell's C-statistic. Findings: 5687 participants, with a mean age of 65·7 years (SD 5·9) in 2007–09, were included and followed up for a median of 10·5 years (IQR 10·1–10·9). Over follow-up, 270 (4·7%) participants were clinically diagnosed with dementia. Cognitive impairment defined using both cognitive performance and decline had higher hazard ratios (from 5·08 [95% CI 3·82–6·76] to 5·48 [4·13–7·26]) for dementia than did definitions based on cognitive performance alone (from 3·25 [2·52–4·17] to 3·39 [2·64–4·36]) and cognitive decline alone (3·01 [2·37–3·82]). However, all definitions had poor predictive performance (C-statistic ranged from 0·591 [0·565–0·616] to 0·631 [0·601–0·660]), primarily due to low sensitivity (21·6–48·4%). A predictive model containing age, sex, and education without measures of cognitive impairment had better predictive performance (C-statistic 0·783 [0·758–0·809], sensitivity 74·2%, specificity 72·2%) than all seven definitions of cognitive impairment (all p<0·0001). Interpretation: These findings suggest that cognitive impairment in early old age might not be useful for dementia prediction, even when it is defined using longitudinal data on cognitive decline and thresholds of poor cognitive performance additionally defined by education or occupation.

High cerebrospinal amyloid-β 42 is associated with normal cognition in individuals with brain amyloidosis,/articles/high-cerebrospinal-amyloid-%CE%B2-42-associated-normal-cognition-individuals-brain-amyloidosis,"This cross-sectional study examined whether levels of soluble Aβ42 are higher in amyloid-positive normal cognition (NC) individuals compared to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background
	Brain amyloidosis does not invariably predict dementia. We hypothesized that high soluble 42-amino acid β amyloid (Aβ42) peptide levels are associated with normal cognition and hippocampal volume despite increasing brain amyloidosis.
	Methods
	This cross-sectional study of 598 amyloid-positive participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort examined whether levels of soluble Aβ42 are higher in amyloid-positive normal cognition (NC) individuals compared to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and whether this relationship applies to neuropsychological assessments and hippocampal volume measured within the same year. All subjects were evaluated between June 2010 and February 2019. Brain amyloid positivity was defined as positron emission tomography-based standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) ≥1.08 for [18] F-florbetaben or 1.11 for [18]F-florbetapir, with higher SUVR indicating more brain amyloidosis. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE4, p-tau, t-tau, and centiloids levels.
	Findings
	Higher soluble Aβ42 levels were observed in NC (864.00 pg/ml) than in MCI (768.60 pg/ml) or AD (617.46 pg/ml), with the relationship between NC, MCI, and AD maintained across all amyloid tertiles. In adjusted analysis, there was a larger absolute effect size of soluble Aβ42 than SUVR for NC (0.82 vs. 0.40) and MCI (0.60 vs. 0.26) versus AD. Each standard deviation increase in Aβ42 was associated with greater odds of NC than AD (adjusted odds ratio, 6.26; p < 0.001) or MCI (1.42; p = 0.006). Higher soluble Aβ42 levels were also associated with better neuropsychological function and larger hippocampal volume.
	Interpretation
	Normal cognition and hippocampal volume are associated with preservation of high soluble Aβ42 levels despite increasing brain amyloidosis.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"For times prior to those represented by the air trapped in Antarctic ice core records, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere must be reconstructed using geochemical proxies. The δ13C of particulate organic carbon (POC) produced in ocean surface waters has previously been observed to covary with the concentration of CO2 in the water. Relative to bulk sedimentary organic carbon, the minute quantity of organic matter trapped within the shell walls of planktonic foraminifera, “foraminifera-bound organic matter” (FBOM), has the potential advantage of being protected from diagenetic alteration and contamination by allochthonous organic matter. Here, with new protocols and instrumentation, FBOM-δ13C is investigated as a potential proxy for the aqueous CO2 concentration ([CO2(aq)]) and thus the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in past surface waters. We achieve a full method precision for FBOM-δ13C of 0.4‰ (1SD) on sample sizes of 20 nanomole C by adding a cryofocus step, a helium sheath flow to the oxidation and reduction reactors, and other modifications to an elemental analyzer and by introducing new approaches to reduce contamination during sample preparation. FBOM-δ13C was analyzed in core-top sediments from the eastern tropical Pacific that span the equatorial maximum in surface water [CO2(aq)]. FBOM-δ13C is lower than predicted for marine phytoplankton, consistent with a substantial lipid component in FBOM. Anticorrelation is observed between FBOM-δ13C and climatological [CO2(aq)]; the relationship is statistically significant (P <0.05) in mixed-species samples and in 4 out of 5 picked species. The slope of the FBOM-δ13C:[CO2(aq)] anticorrelation is equivalent to or greater than has been measured for the δ13C of suspended POC in the surface ocean. Based on the few species analyzed in this study, endosymbiont-bearing and -barren species do not clearly differ from each other either in terms of their average value of FBOM-δ13C or the strength of the FBOM-δ13C:[CO2(aq)] anticorrelation, despite the recognized importance of the photosynthetic endosymbionts as a source of organic carbon for the symbiotic species. Correcting for variations in the δ13C of CO2(aq) and phytoplankton growth rate did not improve the significance of the FBOM-δ13C:[CO2(aq)] anticorrelation.

Embodied emissions of buildings - A forgotten factor in green building certificates,/articles/embodied-emissions-buildings-forgotten-factor-green-building-certificates,"The pre-use stage (construction) emissions of buildings occur in a short time. Wooden buildings seem to emit less compared to concrete ones in pre-use stage according to LCA. Green building certificates need to consider embodied emissions more exhaustively.
",Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities; Goal 13: Climate action,"The construction and use of buildings consume a significant proportion of global energy and natural resources. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is arguably the most international green building certification system and attempts to take actions to limit energy use of buildings and construct them sustainably. While there has been a wide range of research mainly focused on energy use and emission production during the operation phase of LEED-certified buildings, research on embodied emissions is rare. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of LEED regarding initial (pre-use) embodied emissions using life cycle assessment (LCA). The study comprised several steps using a designed model. In the first step, three optional building material scenarios were defined (optimized concrete, hybrid concrete-wood, and wooden buildings) in addition to the base case concrete building located in Iceland. Second, an LCA was conducted for each scenario. Finally, the number of LEED points and the level of LEED certification was assessed for all studied scenarios. In addition, a comparison regarding embodied emissions consideration between LEED and Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) as mostly used green certificate was conducted in the discussion section. The LCA showed the lowest environmental impact for the wooden building followed by the hybrid concrete-wood building. In the LEED framework, wooden and hybrid scenarios obtained 14 and 8 points that were related to material selection. Among these points, only 3 (out of a total of 110 available points) were directly accredited to embodied emissions. The study recommends that the green building certificates increase the weight of sustainable construction materials since the significance of embodied emissions is substantially growing along with the current carbon neutrality goals. As most of the materials for building construction are imported into Iceland, this study is useful for locations similar to Iceland, while overall it is beneficial for the whole world regarding climate change mitigation.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, there is a lack of population based high quality data assessing the differences in HCC epidemiology and outcomes according to Indigenous status. The aim of this study was therefore to perform a large epidemiological study of HCC investigating differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians with HCC. Methods: Study design was a retrospective cohort study. Data linkage methodology was used to link data from cancer registries with hospital separation summaries across three Australian jurisdictions during 2000–2017. Cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier) and the differences in survival (Multivariable Cox-regression) by Indigenous status were assessed. Findings: A total of 229 Indigenous and 3587 non-Indigenous HCC cases were included in the analyses. Significant epidemiological differences identified for Indigenous HCC cases included younger age at onset, higher proportion of females, higher rurality, lower socioeconomic status, and higher comorbidity burden (all p < 0.001). The distribution of cofactors was also significantly different for Indigenous Australians including higher prevalence of alcohol misuse, hepatitis B, and diabetes and more frequent presence of multiple HCC cofactors (all p < 0.001).

To study the effectiveness of the various governance systems in protected area management, we compared species diversity, vegetation structure, and biomass stock of an area under shared governance (wildlife sanctuary) to communal governance (sacred grove). Each protected area was purposively stratified and each stratum assigned condition score based on the degree to which the area has been disturbed. Six spatially separated plots (at least 200 m apart) with sizes 25 × 25 m were demarcated in each of the two protected areas. All trees with a diameter ≥ 10 cm at breast height were inventoried. For each tree, the diameter and height were measured and further used for biomass stock estimation. Each tree conservation significance was determined based on star ratings in-country and the IUCN red list of threatened species database. The study recorded a total of 201 trees consisting of 40 species and 23 families with a higher diversity in the wildlife sanctuary.

For comparisons, isotopic analysis was conducted of bone collagen samples examining carbon (∂13Cco) and nitrogen (∂15N) values of I. portoricensis with two other species of endemic hutia, guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), Antillean slider (Trachemys stejnegeri), rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta) and edible rat (Brotomys sp.) from four sites in the Dominican Republic: El Flaco, El Carril, El Cabo and La Entrada. This data was compared to human and dog collagen values available from El Flaco to assess similarities between these groups. Osteometric data was recorded for hutia mandibles, allowing for body mass estimations (n = 230).

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Viral hepatitis could have an impact on the treatment response in HIV patients. In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C infections and examine the effect on the treatment response in HIV-1 patients attending antiretroviral therapy (ART) centers in the Volta and Oti Regions of Ghana. Method: A longitudinal study design was employed. A cohort of 200 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive adults who met the inclusion criteria (CD4 count ≤350 cells/μl) were enrolled at three ART Centers and initiated on the combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) from January 2014 to December 2015. Blood samples obtained from each participant were subsequently screened for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody. Out of the 200 study respondents recruited, 93 HIV mono-infected were randomly selected plus all 17 HIV co-infected were prospectively followed for twelve months. Using standard methods, three consecutive measurements of CD4 cells, haemoglobin, and liver enzymes [(aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] as well as weight measurements were performed at baseline, six months and twelve months, respectively, after treatment initiation. Result: The overall HIV-viral hepatitis sero-positivity was 8.5%. HBV and HCV co-infections were 7.0% and 1.5% respectively. Among HIV mono-infected CD4 cell count, haemoglobin, and weight significantly increased from baseline to the twelfth month while levels remained statistically comparable in the HIV co-infected patients.

Radiological safety of groundwater around a uranium mine in Namibia,/articles/radiological-safety-groundwater-around-uranium-mine-namibia,This article discusses the radiological safety of groundwater around a uranium mine in Namibia.,Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Uranium mining activities produce the main element used in nuclear energy production. However, it can also negatively affect the environment including groundwater by release of residues or effluent containing radioactive elements. The study investigated the concentration and radiological hazard of uranium in groundwater and seepage water from the tailings of a uranium mine in Namibia. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to assess the concentration of uranium in the groundwater and seepage water and the radiological hazards were determined. The radiological hazard indices Radium equivalent activity (Raeq), Absorbed dose (D), Annual Effective Dose equivalent (AEDE), External hazard index (Hex) and Internal hazard index (Hin) were determined and compared to limits recommended by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). The calculated average value of D and Hin of groundwater is 108.11nGyh−1 and 1.26, respectively and are above the UNSCEAR values (55 nGyh−1 and 1). Further, the average values of Raeq, AEDE and Hex were below the recommended values. The isotopic ratio of uranium radionuclides in groundwater indicates that the uranium in the sampled groundwater is below 1 suggesting it is not natural uranium present but a possible contamination from the mine seepage. The radiological hazard parameters of the seepage water were above the recommended values and thus pose a radiation risk to human and environment.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The joint relief team regularly visited all evacuation shelters across the area to assess the situation of resource supply levels, infrastructural damage, rapid need of resources, and the health status of the evacuees. In this cross-sectional observational study, we evaluated the relationship between the resource supply levels and health status among evacuees in two time periods (days 14–19 and 20–25). Among the evaluated vital resources, clean tap water supply was among the most disrupted by the disaster, and was not fully restored in most shelters during the assessment period. The cross-sectional relationship between resource supplies and morbidity was inconsistent between the two assessment periods, reflecting the multifactorial nature of health status in evacuation shelters. The clean tap water supply level at the first assessment showed a strong negative correlation with the subsequent prevalence of respiratory or gastrointestinal infectious conditions at the second assessment. Restorations in the clean tap water supply and toilet hygiene correlated each other, and both correlated with a decrease in the prevalence of gastrointestinal infectious conditions. In conclusion, disrupted clean tap water supply and inadequate toilet hygiene after a massive disaster would jointly harm the health status of those in shelters.

These factors were inferred via integrated multiproxy methods of high-resolution geological analyses of core sediments obtained from a shallow bay off a coastal plain, along with literature surveys of archeological and historical records. Five intervals were defined based on multivariate analyses of ostracod assemblages. The ostracod assemblage was stable before around the 6th century because of aggradational sedimentation related to gradual increases in sea level. Since then, the composite factors such as the development of a sandy spit near the study site, stable sea level, regional tectonics, regional centennial-scale climatic change possibly related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and flood mitigation by human settlement in the coastal plains triggered the formation of tidal flats and subtidal sandy areas with seagrass beds. This has markedly influenced offshore bay ostracod assemblages since around the 12th century. Anthropogenic impacts, such as reclamation and various artificial constructions since the late 20th century caused the disappearance of seagrass beds, input of coarser sediment into offshore bays, and increased nutrient loads. Therefore, ostracod assemblages have changed drastically. Ostracod assemblages near the boundary between land and sea have been affected by multiple complex factors, such as regional climate and depositional and human-induced processes during the Late Holocene.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Our aim was to quantify ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) registered with primary care practices in England for whom electronic health records were available through the OpenSAFELY platform, and who had at least 1 year of continuous registration at the start of each study period (Feb 1 to Aug 3, 2020 [wave 1], and Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020 [wave 2]). Individual-level primary care data were linked to data from other sources on the outcomes of interest: SARS-CoV-2 testing and positive test results and COVID-19-related hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death. The exposure was self-reported ethnicity as captured on the primary care record, grouped into five high-level census categories (White, South Asian, Black, other, and mixed) and 16 subcategories across these five categories, as well as an unknown ethnicity category. We used multivariable Cox regression to examine ethnic differences in the outcomes of interest. Models were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, clinical factors and comorbidities, and household size, with stratification by geographical region. Findings: Of 17 288 532 adults included in the study (excluding care home residents), 10 877 978 (62·9%) were White, 1 025 319 (5·9%) were South Asian, 340 912 (2·0%) were Black, 170 484 (1·0%) were of mixed ethnicity, 320 788 (1·9%) were of other ethnicity, and 4 553 051 (26·3%) were of unknown ethnicity. In wave 1, the likelihood of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection was slightly higher in the South Asian group (adjusted hazard ratio 1·08 [95% CI 1·07–1·09]), Black group (1·08 [1·06–1·09]), and mixed ethnicity group (1·04 [1·02–1·05]) and was decreased in the other ethnicity group (0·77 [0·76–0·78]) relative to the White group. The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the South Asian group (1·99 [1·94–2·04]), Black group (1·69 [1·62–1·77]), mixed ethnicity group (1·49 [1·39–1·59]), and other ethnicity group (1·20 [1·14–1·28]). Compared with the White group, the four remaining high-level ethnic groups had an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation (South Asian group 1·48 [1·41–1·55], Black group 1·78 [1·67–1·90], mixed ethnicity group 1·63 [1·45–1·83], other ethnicity group 1·54 [1·41–1·69]), COVID-19-related ICU admission (2·18 [1·92–2·48], 3·12 [2·65–3·67], 2·96 [2·26–3·87], 3·18 [2·58–3·93]), and death (1·26 [1·15–1·37], 1·51 [1·31–1·71], 1·41 [1·11–1·81], 1·22 [1·00–1·48]). In wave 2, the risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death relative to the White group were increased in the South Asian group but attenuated for the Black group compared with these risks in wave 1. Disaggregation into 16 ethnicity groups showed important heterogeneity within the five broader categories. Interpretation: Some minority ethnic populations in England have excess risks of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared with the White population, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and household characteristics. Causes are likely to be multifactorial, and delineating the exact mechanisms is crucial. Tackling ethnic inequalities will require action across many fronts, including reducing structural inequalities, addressing barriers to equitable care, and improving uptake of testing and vaccination.

A stress summary score (SSS) incorporated stress, fear of exposure, anxiety/depression and workload (Omega 0.78). Differences from mean were expressed as Cohen's d Effect Sizes (ESs). Regression analyses tested associations with stress and burnout. Findings: Between May 28 and October 1, 2020, 20,947 healthcare workers responded from 42 organizations (median response rate 20%, Interquartile range 7% to 35%).

We hypothesized that residential racial segregation constrains African Americans’ spatial mobility when the whole population is locked down but increases their need for moving under reopening orders. Methods: We employ a Black/White dissimilarity index as our independent variable and county-level mobility ratios as our dependent variable. Using generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data, we analyzed the effects of Black/White segregation on population mobility by counties across the United States from March 8 to August 7, 2020 under two different COVID-19 related policy conditions: lockdown and reopening. Findings: While higher county-wide levels of segregation were significantly associated with decreased mobility under lockdown and stay-at-home orders, we found that this relationship between segregation and mobility dissipated under reopening orders. Interpretations: Investigating the effects of health policy without considering differing effects due to structural racism will likely ignore complexities that may create unintended consequences of health policy. Our conclusions suggest African Americans may face structural limitations to effective social distancing as evidenced by higher rates of mobility after reopening policies go into effect.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Methods: Using the National Cancer Database, we identified patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer from 2004 to 2014. Treatments analyzed included no treatment, cystectomy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus cystectomy (“optimal treatment”), cystectomy plus adjuvant chemotherapy, and chemoradiation. Propensity matching compared mortality outcomes between sexes. Logistic models evaluated predictors of receiving optimal treatment, as well as mortality. Results: Forty seven thousand two hundred and twenty nine patients were identified. Most patients were male (73.4%) and underwent cystectomy alone (69.0%). Propensity score matching demonstrated increased 90-day mortality in women vs men (13.0% vs 11.6%, P =.009), despite adjusting for differences in treatments between sexes. Logistic regression models showed no difference in receipt of optimal treatment between sexes (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.22) although black patients were less likely to receive optimal treatment (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.48). Logistic regression models confirmed increased 90-day mortality in female (OR 1.17, CI 1.08-1.27, P <.001) and black (OR 1.29, CI 1.11-1.50, P =.001) patients. Females had a lower overall survival on Cox regression analysis (Hazard Ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.97). Conclusion: While there do not appear to be significant treatment disparities between sexes, women experience higher 90-day mortality and lower overall survival. Black patients are less likely to receive optimal treatment and have a higher risk of 90-day mortality.

Embedding justice in the 1.5°C transition: A transdisciplinary research agenda,/articles/embedding-justice-15%C2%B0c-transition-transdisciplinary-research-agenda,"Rapid climate action is urgently necessary, but it poses risks to justice. Major justice risks relate to fossil fuel phase-out, increased resource use, distribution of economic impacts, human needs. To mitigate against this we need to be inclusive of diverse voices and able to deal with radical ideas. This paper outlines a way we can do this.
",Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C requires transformations in every aspect of our societies and economies. In contrast to 2°C pathways, the 1.5°C target requires even deeper and faster cuts in emissions. While this will bring enormous collective benefits, mitigation action also risks significant disruptions and losses to some groups. In this Perspective, we set out the justice implications of 1.5°C-consistent modelled pathways, focusing on fossil fuel extraction, critical resources, economic impacts and human needs. This leads to the identification of three cross-cutting characteristics of just transitions to 1.5°C-consistent pathways: the inherently politicised nature of transitions; the need to integrate multiple perspectives; and the challenges they present to values and assumptions. We propose a research agenda which recommends ways in which research must be interdisciplinary, integrative of diverse actors and perspectives, and able to robustly test and explore radical ideas if researchers are to rise to the challenge of delivering just transitions to 1.5°C.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"As part of their efforts to control water pollution, local governments in China introduced the river chief system, whereby a named individual undertakes responsibility for protecting a specified waterway. As one of the most prominent sources of water pollution, agricultural non-point-source (NPS) pollution is becoming increasingly serious. Determining whether the river chief system, an institutional reform in China's decentralized environmental regulation regime, is effective in alleviating NPS pollution is important for the realization of green development. The effect of the river chief system on reducing agricultural NPS pollution is explored in this study using panel data from 308 Chinese counties during the period from 2004 to 2015. The results reveal that the negative impact of manure output from animal breeding operations on surface water quality is reduced with the implementation of the river chief system. However, the river chief system is ineffective in dealing with the water pollution caused by fertilizer use. Furthermore, in the current system, cooperation among river chiefs only occurs within a province. Local governments should increase their efforts in reducing fertilizer source loads and preventing fertilizer loads from entering surface waters. In addition, the central government should improve cooperation among the river chiefs in upstream and downstream provinces.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We extend prior work that found politicized environmental identity mediates a relationship between identification with nature and self-reports of environmental activism (Schmitt, Mackay, et al., 2019) by using observed behavioural indicators of environmental activism: taking pro-environmental buttons (Study 1), donating to an environmental organization (Study 2), or writing pro-environmental letters to politicians (Study 3). In Study 2 the relationship between identification with nature and activist behaviour was fully mediated by politicized environmental identity. In Studies 1 and 3, politicized environmental identity partially mediated a relationship between identification with nature and observed activist behaviour.

The study found systemic differences in calibration across ethnicities.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Despite wide use of severity scoring systems for case-mix determination and benchmarking in the intensive care unit (ICU), the possibility of scoring bias across ethnicities has not been examined. Guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilation, during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of the severity scoring systems Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa (APACHE IVa), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) across four ethnicities in two large ICU databases to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. Methods: Data from the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, built from patient episodes in the USA from 2014–15 and 2001–12, respectively, were analysed for score performance in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White people after appropriate exclusions. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups, using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for different ethnicities to assess discrimination, and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) or proxy measures to assess calibration. Findings: We analysed 166 751 participants (122 919 eICU-CRD and 43 832 MIMIC-III). Although measurements of discrimination were significantly different among the groups (AUROC ranging from 0·86 to 0·89 [p=0·016] with APACHE IVa and from 0·75 to 0·77 [p=0·85] with OASIS), they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. However, measurements of calibration indicated persistent, and in some cases statistically significant, patterns of difference between Hispanic people (SMR 0·73 with APACHE IVa and 0·64 with OASIS) and Black people (0·67 and 0·68) versus Asian people (0·77 and 0·95) and White people (0·76 and 0·81). Although calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently showed a pattern of overpredicting mortality for Black people and Hispanic people. Similar results were seen using SOFA scores across the two databases. Interpretation: The systematic differences in calibration across ethnicities suggest that illness severity scores reflect statistical bias in their predictions of mortality.

We expected concordance between the two groups based on shared historical environmental drivers and presumed strong butterfly-host plant specializations. We instead found that biodiversity patterns in butterflies are strikingly different from flowering plants, especially warm deserts. In particular, butterflies show different patterns of phylogenetic clustering compared with flowering plants, suggesting differences in habitat conservation between the two groups.

Paths out of poverty: International experience,/articles/paths-out-poverty-international-experience,"It reviews the international experience to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.
",Goal 1: No poverty; Goal 2: Zero hunger,"The global community has committed, as the first priority of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. While the decline of global poverty continues, progress has slowed and remains uneven through different parts of the world. To ensure that no one is left behind in China and beyond, research will be critical to inform paths out of poverty. In this regard, it is valuable to take stock of international experiences and the various pathways out of poverty with a focus on agriculture. Africa's agricultural growth has been largely driven by land expansion and poverty reduction has been the slowest among all regions. South Asia agriculture has been led by diversification of smallholder agriculture and its poverty reduction impact has been large, but its future poverty reduction is limited by rural–urban migration and lack of formal jobs in urban centers. Social protection programs have been used by many Latin American countries as the region is more urbanized than any other developing regions. China's agricultural and economic success was driven by agriculture-led reforms and rural development. These changes brought significantly higher incomes among rural residents, which accounted for highest initial levels of poverty and hunger, and in increased availability of food at affordable prices. Investments in nutrition, health, education, clean water, and good sanitation also complemented progress. The foremost lesson is that smallholder-led agriculture growth in land scarce countries often have the largest impact on poverty reduction. Secondly, nonfarm employment and rural–urban migration must follow once agricultural productivity has reached a certain level. However, premature exiting from agriculture can do more harm. Thirdly, even before large scale poverty reduction through sectoral and regional development is exhausted, social safety nets must be established to cover those who have not benefited from growth and development. Productive social safety nets have proven to be cost-effective in many countries. Urban poverty should also be part of the protection scheme when large proportion of rural population moves to cities.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"In the present work we intend to discuss groundwater contamination and its susceptibility in Serra Geral Aquifer, in Brazil. For this purpose, a list of data concerning the wells located in the study region was elaborated, obtained from the Groundwater Information System (GIS) of the Geological Survey of Brazil. Moreover, data on land use occupancy from United States Geological Survey (USGS) images was constructed. In order to determine local susceptibility to contamination, cross-referencing data was obtained based on the susceptibility index (SI) as well as from methodologies and the pollutant origin and surcharge hydraulically (POSH) system. The results pointed that the SI of the municipality of Sarandi (Brazil, RS) ranged from very low (37%) to high (76%) contamination susceptibility. Included on these, 12% is in the very low range, 17,6% in low, 13% in moderate to low, 13,2% in moderate to high, and 44% in high contamination susceptibility. Furthermore, potential sources of pollutant load are concentrated in areas where the contamination SI has scored from moderate to high.

Ethnic inequalities in health-related quality of life among older adults in England: secondary analysis of a national cross-sectional survey,/articles/ethnic-inequalities-health-related-quality-life-among-older-adults-england-secondary-0,"This Article supports SDGs 3 and 10 by evaluating ethnic inequalities in health among older adults (55 years or older) in England. The large, cross-sectional study includes more than a million survey respondents, and identifies wide ethnic inequalities in health-related quality of life, prevalence of long-term conditions, experiences of primary care, support from local services, and confidence in managing one's own health. Outcomes varied widely between minority ethnic groups, both in the direction and magnitude of associations.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: The population of older adults (ie, those aged ≥55 years) in England is becoming increasingly ethnically diverse. Previous reports indicate that ethnic inequalities in health exist among older adults, but information is limited by the paucity of data from small minority ethnic groups. This study aimed to analyse inequalities in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and five determinants of health in older adults across all ethnic groups in England. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we analysed data from five waves (July 1, 2014, to April 7, 2017) of the nationally representative English General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS). Study participants were adults aged 55 years or older who were registered with general practices in England. We used regression models (age-adjusted and stratified by gender) to estimate the association between ethnicity and HRQoL, measured by use of the EQ-5D-5L index and its domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression). We also estimated associations between ethnicity and five determinants of health (presence of long-term conditions or multimorbidity, experience of primary care, degree of support from local services, patient self-confidence in managing own health, and degree of area-level social deprivation). We examined robustness to differential handling of missing data, alternative EQ-5D-5L value sets, and differences in area-level social deprivation. Findings: There were 1 416 793 GPPS respondents aged 55 years and older. 1 394 361 (98·4%) respondents had complete data on ethnicity and gender and were included in our analysis. Of these, 152 710 (11·0%) self-identified as belonging to minority ethnic groups. HRQoL was worse for men or women, or both, in 15 (88·2%) of 17 minority ethnic groups than the White British ethnic group. In both men and women, inequalities were widest for Gypsy or Irish Traveller (linear regression coefficient −0·192 [95% CI −0·318 to −0·066] in men; −0·264 [–0·354 to −0·173] in women), Bangladeshi (−0·111 [–0·136 to −0·087] in men; −0·209 [–0·235 to −0·184] in women), Pakistani (−0·084 [–0·096 to −0·073] in men; −0·206 [–0·219 to −0·193] in women), and Arab (−0·061 [–0·086 to −0·035] in men; −0·145 [–0·180 to −0·110] in women) ethnic groups, with magnitudes generally greater for women than men. Differentials tended to be widest for the self-care EQ-5D-5L domain. Ethnic inequalities in HRQoL were accompanied by increased prevalence of long-term conditions or multimorbidity, poor experiences of primary care, insufficient support from local services, low patient self-confidence in managing their own health, and high area-level social deprivation, compared with the White British group. Interpretation: We found evidence of wide ethnic inequalities in HRQoL and five determinants of health for older adults in England. Outcomes varied between minority ethnic groups, highlighting heterogeneity in the direction and magnitude of associations. We recommend further research to understand the drivers of inequalities, together with policy changes to improve equity of socioeconomic opportunity and access to services for older adults from minority ethnic groups.

The findings show substantial disparities in uptake and suggest that new strategies are urgently needed to address these inequities.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) uptake among US adults aged 65 years or older remains suboptimal and stagnant. Further, there is growing concern around racial and ethnic disparities in uptake. We aimed to assess racial and ethnic disparities in overall SIV and in high-dose vaccine (HDV) uptake among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2015–16 influenza season and sought to identify possible mediators for observed disparities. Methods: We did a historical record-linkage cohort study using Medicare (a US national health insurance programme) databases, which included all older adults (≥65 years) enrolled in Medicare during the study period (July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016). We excluded beneficiaries of Medicare Part C (managed care offered by private companies), and residents of long-term care facilities. The primary outcome was SIV receipt during the study period, classified into receipt of HDV and standard-dose vaccines (SDVs, representing all other SIVs). SIV uptake probabilities were estimated using competing-risk survival analysis methods. Mediation analyses were done to investigate potential mediators of the association between race and ethnicity and uptake. Findings: During the study period, of 26·5 million beneficiaries in the study cohort, 47·4% received a SIV, 52·7% of whom received HDV. Compared with white beneficiaries (49·4%), Hispanic (29·1%), Black (32·6%), and Asian (47·6%) beneficiaries were less likely to be vaccinated and, when vaccinated, were less likely to receive HDV (37·8% for Hispanic people, 41·1% for Black people, and 40·3% for Asian people, compared with 53·8% of white people who received HDV). Among those vaccinated, after accounting for region, income, chronic conditions, and health-care use, minority groups were 26–32% less likely to receive HDV, relative to white people (odds ratio [OR] 0·68 [95% CI 0·68–0·69] for Black people; OR 0·71 [0·71–0·72] for Asian people; and OR 0·74 [0·73–0·74] for Hispanic people). Interpretation: Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in SIV uptake among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older are evident.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy,"The public health community has tried for decades to show, through evidence-based research, that safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and clean cooking fuels that reduce household air pollution are essential to safeguard health and save lives in low-income and middle-income countries. In the past 40 decades, there have been many innovations in the development of low-cost and efficacious technologies for WASH and household air pollution, but many of these technologies have been associated with disappointing health outcomes, often because low-income households have either not adopted, or inconsistently adopted, these technologies. In this Viewpoint, we argue that public health researchers (ourselves included) have had an oversimplified understanding of poverty; our work has not focused on insights into the lived experience of poverty, with its uncertainties, stresses from constant scarcity, and attendant fears. Such insights are central to understanding why technologies for safe water or clean cooking are unused by so many households that could benefit from them. We argue that, rather than improved versions of household-scale delivery models, transformative investments in safe water and clean cooking for all require utility-scale service models.

",Goal 1: No poverty; Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: In 2010, the UK government implemented austerity measures, involving reductions to public spending and welfare reform. We aimed to systematically review the relationship of austerity policies with food insecurity including foodbank use in the UK. Methods: We undertook a narrative systematic review (CRD42020164508) and searched seven databases, grey literature, and reference lists through September 2020. Studies with austerity policies (including welfare reform) as exposure and food insecurity (including foodbank use as a proxy) as study outcome were included. We included quantitative longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. Two reviewers assessed eligibility, extracted data directly from studies, and undertook quality assessment. Findings: Eight studies were included: two individual-level studies totalling 4129 participants and six ecological studies. All suggested a relationship between austerity and increased food insecurity. Two studies found that austerity policies were associated with increased food insecurity in European countries including the UK. Six studies found that the welfare reform aspect of UK austerity policies was associated with increased food insecurity and foodbank use. Sanctions involving delays to benefits as a response to a claimant not actively seeking work may increase food insecurity, with studies finding that increases of 100 sanctions per 100,000 people may have led to increases of between 2 and 36 food parcels per 100,000 population. Interpretation: UK austerity policies were consistently linked to food insecurity and foodbank use. Policymakers should consider impacts of austerity on food insecurity when considering how to reduce budget deficits.

Sustainable wildlife protection on the Qingzang Plateau,/articles/sustainable-wildlife-protection-qingzang-plateau,"This article supports SDG 15 by demonstrating both climate change and social-economic developments play important roles to wildlife recovery in Qingzang Plateau.  How to effectively promote the wildlife restoration and conservation in Qingzang Plateau is challenging.
",Goal 15: Life on land,"Besides its ecological services to China and even Asia, the Qingzang Plateau (QP) hosts a rich variety of wildlife species. During the last century, wildlife population decreased quickly on the QP, driven by human interventions. Recently, wildlife has witnessed rapid recovery mainly propelled by a series of wildlife conservation policies. However, some cautions merit attentions to sustain wildlife restoration and conservation on the QP. This paper casted an overview of environmental and social-economic changes on the QP affecting wildlife subsistence. Results show that QP has been warming, which can benefit wildlife recovery by easing extreme low temperature stresses. The fast growing social economy across the QP lays a solid economic foundation for investing on wildlife protection. Measures such as establishing conservation areas, constructing wildlife pathway corridors, and encouraging herdsman moving out from wildlife rich regions, have boosted wildlife recovery. However, wildlife recovery is constrained by the limited carrying capacity of the ecosystem, left by domestic livestock. Additionally, fences intended to delineate conservation areas or to separate each type of grassland use, have brought about profound side effects on wildlife through fragmentation of their habitats. It is recommended to set up the fence in a more ecological way, which can be achieved by bypassing the wildlife frequent pathway and using materials devoid of steel barb.

Objective: To identify the features and preferences of a blood donation smartphone app for blood donation centers and donors in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a mixed-method study composed of a quantitative cross-sectional part (with donors, using a self-administered questionnaire), and a qualitative/quantitative part (with blood donation center staff, using semi-structured interviews). Data were collected between 15 November 2017 and 5 February 2018, from four blood donation centers in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia.

Most participants were males (90.3 %). Less than half (40.5%) of the survey respondents described themselves as “comfortable with technology”. The top-rated features (by donors) were the ability to ask for donors when needed and the ability to locate the nearest blood center (70.8% and 67.8% considering these “useful” or “very useful”, respectively). Most (67%) donors claimed that they are “concerned” or “very concerned” about their personal information being used for other purposes, and a similar percentage of respondents (65.8%) agreed that they are concern about receiving too many alerts or messages. There was a significant decrease in the likelihood of using the app (by 75%) among the 46- to 60-year-old age group, compared to the 18- to 23-year-old age group, after adjusting for educational level (OR = 0.25, p = 0.003, CI = 0.1–0.62). Twelve individuals working in the four studied blood donation centers participated in the semi-structured interviews. Most participants emphasized the importance of providing the donation educational material, showing the blood donation center‟s location on a map, and calculating the donors‟ eligibility. Conclusions: Donors were highly interested in using the blood donation app. However, areas of concern, including privacy and confidentiality, should be considered during design and development. Age was identified as a contributing factor that might decrease the likelihood of app usage among donors. The donation center staff focused on the educational features of the 4 app and emphasized the importance of the app providing statistics and sending notifications and reminders to donors.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Interventions adapted peripheral intervention components by, for example, translation and reducing the stigma of psychological therapy by emphasising physical illness and learning. Core therapeutic components were not changed. We found evidence-based, multicomponent interventions adapted for Latinx carers were acceptable, feasible, and effective in the USA and Columbia. Interventions developed for carers in India were effective there but not in other LMICs. Culturally adapted cognitive stimulation therapy was acceptable and effective for people with dementia in sub-Saharan Africa. We propose a new conceptual model from our findings to aid implementation of culturally appropriate treatments for people affected by dementia in LMICs and minority ethnic groups.

Transportation physical activity earlier in life and areas of the brain related to dementia later in life,/articles/transportation-physical-activity-earlier-life-and-areas-brain-related-dementia-later-life,"The article examines the link between physical activity earlier in life and a lower risk of dementia later in life.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Introduction: Efforts to preserve brain function may be most effective when administered before there are changes in the brain, which may occur decades before the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a cardiovascular disease biomarker, are areas of hyperintense signals scattered in the white matter of the brain evident on magnetic resonance images. WMH increase with age and are associated with a higher risk of dementia. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was an association between different domains and intensities of physical activity earlier in life and lower risk of dementia later in life as indicated by less WMH. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, face-to-face interviews were conducted with the Lifetime Total Physical Activity Questionnaire. The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours/week/year of moderate (3.0–5.9 METs) and vigorous-intensity (≥6 METs) occupation, transportation, household and leisure-time physical activity was obtained across school-age (6–11), adolescence (12–18), young (19–39) and middle adulthood (40–64). WMH were calculated as the percent of intracranial volume in cognitively unimpaired middle (age 40–64) and older adults (age 65+). Simultaneous multiple linear regression determined associations between moderate and vigorous-intensity occupation, transportation, household and leisure-time physical activity across school-age, adolescence, young and middle adulthood with WMH. Results: Greater moderate-intensity transportation physical activity during young (b = −0.09, p = .008) and middle adulthood (b = −0.14, p = .013) was associated with lower WMH in middle and older adulthood, explaining 28% (p = .003) to 29% (p=.002) of the variance in WMH (n = 54). Conclusions: Changes to the physical environment that encourage walking, running or biking, such as sidewalks and bike paths, may be strategies to mitigate the age-related increases in WMH, areas of the brain associated with higher risk of dementia.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"Background: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a robust vertical global health programme. The extent to which vertical programmes financially support health security has not been investigated. We, therefore, endeavoured to quantify the extent to which the budgets of this vertical programme support health security. We believe this is a crucial area of work as the global community works to combine resources for COVID-19 response and future pandemic preparedness. Methods: We examined budgets for work in Kenya, Uganda, Vietnam, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone from January, 2014 to December, 2020. These ten countries were selected because of the robustness of investments and the availability of data. Using the International Health Regulations Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool as a framework, we mapped budget line items to health security capacities. Two researchers independently reviewed each budget and mapped items to the JEE. Budgets were then jointly reviewed until a consensus was reached regarding if an item supported health security directly, indirectly, or not at all. The budgets for the study countries were inputted into a single Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and line items that mapped to JEE indicators were scaled up to their respective JEE capacity. Descriptive analyses were then done to determine the total amount of money budgeted for activities that support health security, how much was budgeted for each JEE capacity, and how much of the support was direct or indirect. Findings: The research team reviewed 37 budgets. Budgets totalled US$6 927 284 966, and $2 562 063 054 (37·0%) of this mapped to JEE capacities. $1 330 942 712 (19·2%) mapped directly to JEE capacities and $1 231 120 342 (17·8%) mapped indirectly to JEE capacities. Laboratory systems, antimicrobial resistance, and the deployment of medical countermeasures and personnel received the most overall budgetary support; laboratory systems, antimicrobial resistance, and workforce development received the greatest amount of direct budgetary support. Interpretation: Over one-third of the Global Fund's work also supports health security and the organisation has budgeted more than $2 500 000 000 for activities that support health security in ten countries since 2014. Although these funds were not budgeted specifically for health security purposes, recognising how vertical programmes can synergistically support other global health efforts has important implications for policy related to health systems strengthening.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"BACKGROUND: The daily use of low-dose aspirin may be a safe, widely available, and inexpensive intervention for reducing the risk of preterm birth. Data on the potential side effects of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy in low- and middle-income countries are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess differences in unexpected emergency medical visits and potential maternal side effects from a randomized, double-blind, multicountry, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin use (81 mg daily, from 6 to 36 weeks’ gestation). STUDY DESIGN: This study was a secondary analysis of data from the Aspirin Supplementation for Pregnancy Indicated Risk Reduction In Nulliparas trial, a trial of the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health conducted in India (2 sites), Pakistan, Guatemala, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Zambia. The outcomes for this analysis were unexpected emergency medical visits and the occurrence of the following potential side effects—overall and separately—nausea, vomiting, rash or hives, diarrhea, gastritis, vaginal bleeding, allergic reaction, and any other potential side effects. Analyses were performed overall and by geographic region. RESULTS: Between the aspirin (n=5943) and placebo (n=5936) study groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of unexpected emergency medical visits or the risk of any potential side effect (overall). Of the 8 potential side effects assessed, only 1 (rash or hives) presented a different risk by treatment group (4.2% in the aspirin group vs 3.5% in the placebo group; relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.43; P=.042).

",Goal 15: Life on land,"Reindeer herding emerged among the indigenous Sámi of Northern Fennoscandia between ca. 800 and 1500 CE. While the details of the reindeer domestication process are still actively debated, it has been hypothesized that the transition to reindeer herding affected Sámi ritual practice, especially animal offerings given at various sacred sites. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed DNA from reindeer bone samples dating to ca. 1200–1700 CE from Sámi offering sites located in present-day Northern Finland as well as from samples originating from ancient dwelling site in Southern Finland and Kola Peninsula, Russia. The results show that haplotypes related to wild Finnish forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) began to be replaced by haplotypes common in modern domesticated reindeer in the faunal assemblages from offering sites starting between 1400 and 1600 CE.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Type 2 diabetes affects Indigenous and non-European populations disproportionately, including in New Zealand, where long-term temporal trends in cause-specific clinical outcomes between Māori, Pacific, and European people remain unclear. We aimed to compare the rates of mortality and hospital admission between Māori, Pacific, and European patients with type 2 diabetes in Auckland, New Zealand, over a period of 24 years. Methods: In this retrospective, population-based, longitudinal cohort study, we identified a cohort of patients (aged 35–84 years) with type 2 diabetes enrolled between Jan 1, 1994, and July 31, 2018, to the primary care audit programme, the Diabetes Care Support Service (DCSS) in Auckland, New Zealand. Patients with type 1 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes were excluded. We linked data from the DCSS with national death registration, hospital admission, pharmaceutical claim, and socioeconomic status databases. Patients were followed up until death or July 31, 2018 (date of last enrolment to the DCSS). Incident clinical events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, cardiovascular hospital admission, cancer hospital admission, and end-stage renal disease hospital admission) were identified. Event rates were stratified by ethnic group, age group, sex, socioeconomic status, and time period (<1998, 1999–2013, 2004–08, 2009–13, and 2014–18). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and absolute risk differences were adjusted for sex, age, smoking status, obesity, socioeconomic status, and time period by use of age-period-cohort modelling. Findings: Between Jan 1, 1994, and July 31, 2018, 45 072 patients with type 2 diabetes (21 936 [48·7%] female; mean age 56·7 years [SD 13·8]) were enrolled in the DCSS and followed up for a median of 9·7 years (IQR 5·8–13·6). 16 755 (37·2%) were European, 7093 (15·7%) were Māori, and 12 044 (26·7%) were Pacific patients. Despite a similar temporal trend (decreasing mortality and increasing hospital admissions) across the three ethnic groups, Māori and Pacific patients had consistently higher hospital admission rates than European patients. Māori but not Pacific patients had higher adjusted IRRs for all-cause mortality (1·96 [95% CI 1·80–2·14]), cardiovascular mortality (1·93 [1·63–2·29]) and cancer mortality (1·64 [1·40–1·93]) rates compared with European patients. Interpretation: Compared with European patients, poorer health outcomes have persisted among Māori and Pacific people with type 2 diabetes for more than 20 years. New policies supporting prevention and more intensive management of type 2 diabetes are urgently needed. Research into the biological and societal mechanisms underlying these disparities, and the associated differences between Māori and Pacific patients is also needed.

This complexity renders freshwater challenges difficult to govern and manage. We here propose a framework for understanding water's many functions for supporting, regulating, and stabilizing hydro-climatic, hydro-ecological, and hydro-social systems. This framework recognizes human impacts on major partitioning points, interactions among water functions, and stabilization and destabilization processes. A functional understanding of the freshwater cycle can integrate with social-ecological resilience-building principles, complement existing water sustainability governance approaches, and highlight the potential need for Earth-system-level governance of water. Recognizing water's diverse functional roles for resilience may promote a new generation of holistic and integrative water-land-climate governance. The freshwater cycle supports, regulates, and stabilizes the terrestrial biosphere and all social-ecological systems on Earth. However, a vast range of human activities across the land-water-climate continuum now modifies freshwater and gives rise to complex dynamics that renders freshwater challenging to govern in the Anthropocene.

Here, we use water, a key sustainability resource, to advance SDG science by (1) assessing the synergies and trade-offs of improved water security on achieving the SDGs, (2) examining all the SDGs simultaneously, and (3) using a statistical analysis approach to synthesize the main interconnections. Our results show that water security positively contributed to all SDGs, especially SDG3 (good health) and SDG2 (zero hunger). Negative linkages (9% of all identified linkages) were potentially underrepresented and hampered critical assessment of water's links to the SDGs. The method may be used for other natural resources and their potential in supporting SDG implementation. Finally, more attention must be paid to the potential mutual benefits, and particularly the trade-offs, associated with SDG linkages. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an ensemble of 17 overarching goals ranging from human health to protecting aquatic life. Understanding their interlinkages is pivotal for achieving sustainable development, which is hindered by studies focusing only on few goals. We use water, a key resource, to advance knowledge of the synergies and trade-offs. We examine how improved water security affects the success of other SDGs, when all the goals are examined simultaneously. Our statistical analysis approach shows that water security positively contributed to all the SDGs, especially good health and zero hunger. Only 9% of the linkages in the literature were negative, indicating that they possibly are underrepresented or the positive ones are overrepresented. The method is also suitable for other natural resources to identify their potential in sustainability. For sustainability attempts, more attention should be paid to mutual benefits and especially to the trade-offs among SDGs. We provide a statistical assessment of the interlinkages among SDGs by examining how improved water security contributes to all SDGs.

Systematic review into city interventions to address obesity,/articles/systematic-review-city-interventions-address-obesity,"A Research Paper on obesity, in the context of SDGs 3, 9, and 11, focusing specifically on the role of multi-level and multi-component interventions addressing healthy nutrition, physical activity, and education to mitigate the rising epidemic.
","Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities","Background: Obesity threatens to undo the improvements that have been made in life expectancy over the last two centuries. It disproportionately affects lower socioeconomic and ethnic minority groups and has become one of the most important global health challenges of the 21stcentury. Whilst obesity is not confined to city populations, cities are home to more than half of the world's population with concentrated groups at high risk of obesity. Cities have also long been the forefront of social and technological change that has led to our current obesogenic environment. The aim of this study was to systematically identify city-wide interventions to address obesity, from which recommendations for policy makers, health system leaders and political leaders in cities could be made. Methods: Systematic review, conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, examining Embase, Ovid Medline, Central, Scopus, Campbell Library, CINALH, Health Business Elite; Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), PyschINFO and Prospero. No restrictions on article type, date range or geographic location were applied. Along with classic academic sources, books and policy white papers were sought and reviewed. Studies that described a city-wide intervention to reduce obesity were included, irrespective of study design or perceived methodological quality. Only studies in English language were included. The primary outcome indicators that were sought and extracted were: reduction in obesity, reduction in weight and/or reduction in BMI. Where a primary outcome indicator was not stated, any other secondary impact measure was identified and recorded. This manuscript represents thematic analysis of a sub-set of data from the Prospero study, registration number: CRD42020166210 Findings: Our search yielded 42,137 original citations of which 1614 met the inclusion criteria and 96 were coded as relating to obesity. The 96 citations, ranging in year of publication 1997 to 2019, were conducted in 36 cities, with 13 citations either not stating a city or covering multiple cities, across 5 continents. The highest proportion of publications were from North America (59 / 96) and in particular the USA (56/96) and New York City (23/96). Primary outcome indicators were only stated in one quarter of the identified studies (24/96). Overall, there was heterogeneity of study design, descriptive methodologies and publication types, with a majority being descriptive texts using qualitative instruments of assessment. Interpretation: Multi-level and multi-component interventions, at the individual, community and city level, done in concert, are needed to address obesity. A composite of interventions that cities can utilise to address obesity is provided. These interventions will also be beneficial to the environment and make the case that personal health and planetary health are inextricably linked and should be considered as one.

Themes were broadly classified under five governance areas: policy design, implementation tools, monitoring and evaluation, sustainability, and One Health engagement. We identified policy priorities, useful features of NAPs, and specific areas that should be strengthened, including accountability, sustained engagement, equity, behavioural economics, sustainability plans and transparency, international collaboration, as well as integration of the environmental sector.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 13: Climate action,"Zoonoses, which are diseases that are transmitted naturally from animals to humans, are one of the leading public health threats [1]. Globally, the World Health Organization estimated about 1 billion cases of illness and millions of death per annum from zoonoses, thus a public health concern to the human population [1]. Apparently, only a few existing scientific publications on zoonoses show that climate change and biodiversity loss have a part to play in the incidence and distributions of zoonotic diseases in the human population. Impact of climate change and biodiversity loss on zoonotic diseases which is evident by shifts in distribution and behavioral changes of vectors and animals’ species contribute to the spread and emergence of zoonotic diseases [2]. Several studies allude to the fact that a common factor in the emergence of zoonotic disease outbreaks is their coincidence with climate change and biodiversity loss. Outbreaks of Chikungunya fever, West Nile fever, Hantavirus, Lyme disease, Lujo virus, and Ebola disease have been linked with climate change and biodiversity loss as shown in reviews by Rajan and colleagues, and Naicker respectively [2,3].

Globally, approximately 12.2 million workers are entrapped in modern slavery in environmentally degrading activities, and SDG target 8.7 (the elimination of all forms of modern slavery) may be instrumental in accelerating attainment of other SDG targets. However, without appropriate mitigation strategies, the attainment of some of the SDG's environmental targets may also negatively influence progress on 8.7. Unfortunately, these feedbacks are poorly understood and data are limited and difficult to obtain. In this perspective we show how an SDG interaction framework may help overcome these data challenges by signaling how potential policy action and other interventions would influence progress on 8.7 and other environmental targets based on known processes and patterns. This understanding is crucial to move beyond data limitations, direct future research, and develop an often-lacking evidence-base to effect holistic change. The modern slavery–environmental degradation–climate change nexus may threaten the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this perspective we present how an SDG interaction framework may help to overcome data challenges around feedbacks between SDG target 8.7 and the environmental targets.

",Goal 13: Climate action,"Limited information and insufficient resources are inherent challenges for climate policy, and policy makers must grapple with how to design and implement adaptation policies under conditions of scarcity. Drawing on empirical evidence from Honduras, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Puerto Rico, and analysis of the global landscape of adaptation finance, this perspective identifies ways that designing policy under conditions of scarcity can inadvertently lead to adaptation policies that reinforce inequality and fail to address underlying social vulnerabilities. It reflects on two sources of scarcity that impact adaptation policy—lack of data and lack of finance—and acknowledges that despite the non-ideal conditions this scarcity creates, adaptation policy will be designed under these conditions. The perspective highlights issues to be aware of when designing adaptation policy and calls for greater attention to the social justice implications in the policy design process. Limited information and insufficient resources are inherent challenges for climate policy, and policy makers must grapple with how to design and implement adaptation policies under conditions of scarcity.

Cognitive and social activities and long-term dementia risk: the prospective UK Million Women Study,/articles/cognitive-and-social-activities-and-long-term-dementia-risk-prospective-uk-million-women,"An article on the long-term risk of dementia, in the context of SDG 3, focusing specifically on the association between dementia onset and reduced participation in cognitive and social activities.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Although dementia is associated with non-participation in cognitive and social activities, this association might merely reflect the consequences of dementia, rather than any direct effect of non-participation on the subsequent incidence of dementia. Because of the slowness with which dementia can develop, unbiased assessment of any such direct effects must relate non-participation in such activities to dementia detection rates many years later. Prospective studies with long-term follow-up can help achieve this by analysing separately the first and second decade of follow-up. We report such analyses of a large, 20-year study. Methods: The UK Million Women Study is a population-based prospective study of 1·3 million women invited for National Health Service (NHS) breast cancer screening in median year 1998 (IQR 1997–1999). In median year 2001 (IQR 2001–2003), women were asked about participation in adult education, groups for art, craft, or music, and voluntary work, and in median year 2006 (IQR 2006–2006), they were asked about reading. All participants were followed up through electronic linkage to NHS records of hospital admission with mention of dementia, the first mention of which was the main outcome. Comparing non-participation with participation in a particular activity, we used Cox regression to assess fully adjusted dementia risk ratios (RRs) during 0–4, 5–9, and 10 or more years, after information on that activity was obtained. Findings: In 2001, 851 307 women with a mean age of 60 years (SD 5) provided information on participation in adult education, groups for art, craft, or music, and voluntary work. After 10 years, only 9591 (1%) had been lost to follow-up and 789 339 (93%) remained alive with no recorded dementia. Follow-up was for a mean of 16 years (SD 3), during which 31 187 (4%) had at least one hospital admission with mention of dementia, including 25 636 (3%) with a hospital admission with dementia mentioned for the first time 10 years or more after follow-up began. Non-participation in cognitive or social activities was associated with higher relative risks of dementia detection only during the first decade after participation was recorded. During the second decade, there was little association. This was true for non-participation in adult education (RR 1·04, 99% CI 0·98–1·09), in groups for art, craft, or music (RR 1·04, 0·99–1·09), in voluntary work (RR 0·96, 0·92–1·00), or in any of these three (RR 0·99, 0·95–1·03). In 2006, 655 118 women provided information on reading. For non-reading versus any reading, there were similar associations with dementia, again with strong attenuation over time since reading was recorded, but longer follow-up is needed to assess this reliably. Interpretation: Life has to be lived forwards, but can be understood only backwards. Long before dementia is diagnosed, there is a progressive reduction in various mental and physical activities, but this is chiefly because its gradual onset causes inactivity and not because inactivity causes dementia.

Using a process of expert face-to-face consultation and an online Delphi consultation, we found a high degree of agreement regarding the criteria for the optimum target product profile. Although the minimum attributes for a cure were debated, the broad consensus was that an acceptable cure need not be as safe and effective as optimally delivered antiretroviral therapy.

Pistachio trees were grown under rainfed conditions for two growing seasons. Gravel mulching (vertical and horizontal) and 36 m2 micro-catchment had the highest percentage increase in plant height compared with other treatments. In addition, 36 m2 micro-catchment significantly increased gas exchange variables (Pn, gs, and E). We partially attributed that to higher soil water content and Ψsmd in the 36 m2 compared with 64 and 100 m2 micro-catchment. Interestingly, the runoff water collected from 36 m2 treatment was 75 % higher than 64 m2 (53.4 vs. 30.6 L) and 28 % higher than 100 m2 (53.4 vs. 41.7 L). Therefore, the 36 m2 is the best micro-catchment area in term of runoff efficiency.

",Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities; Goal 4: Quality education,"Young motherhood is often framed as detrimental to the life chances of young women with research showing negative impacts on education and labor market outcomes.

These scenarios appear contradictory, however outcomes might vary for different groups of women depending on their pre-birth trajectories. We investigate the effects of early parenthood using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. We employ a sequence based approach to compare labor market- and educational precarity of young mothers and non-parenting peers. We employ a novel sequence matching technique creating a comparison group of non-parenting young women, based on similarities in early labor market trajectories. We find that young mothers have higher levels of precarity in their pre-birth trajectories. Moreover, our results show that becoming a young mother is connected to an average increase in labor market and educational precarity post birth, which supports the hypothesis of cumulative disadvantage. However, only mothers with the least precarious trajectories prior to birth experience this development, whereas young women already on highly precarious paths see a decrease in precarity over time. Although our results do not support cumulative disadvantage for the most disadvantaged women, neither does it support the idea of parenthood as a transformative event.

In this study, we investigated the effect of phosphate functionalisation on the removal of uranyl ions from mine-drainage contaminated water. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets functionalised through the Arbuzov reaction were therefore synthesized and characterized for structure, elemental composition and functionalisation. Adsorptive removal of uranyl [U(VI)] ions by the nanosheets was then examined in batch studies as a factor of time, pH, U(VI) concentration, and adsorbent concentration. X-ray diffraction confirmed the synthesis of GO nanosheets from graphite, while the presence of phosphate groups in GO was confirmed by FTIR. TEM images revealed a tendency for stacking, particularly for functionalised nanosheets. Adsorption of U(VI) from solution was found to be optimal at pH 4 for both GO and GO-PO4. However, adsorption by GO-PO4 attained equilibrium earlier and was >15% higher than that of GO, effects ascribed to the phosphate functionalisation. Importantly, even in mine-drainage contaminated water (pH 2.78) GO-PO4 out-performed GO by >30%.

In this study, we explored these time-varying associations. Methods: We used data from the first four waves (October, 2013, to February, 2017) of a national refugee-based longitudinal study, the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) project. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and high risk of severe mental illness (HR-SMI) were used to assess mental health. The independent variables included the number of potentially traumatic events experienced during the pre-migration process, and a range of post-migration stressors. We used logistic regression models to analyse the relative importance of variables and time-varying associations between the pre-migration potentially traumatic events, post-migration resettlement stressors, and refugees' mental health. Analyses were stratified by gender, and sociodemographic covariates included age, marital status, education level, country of birth, and weekly income. Results: 2399 participants were surveyed in Wave 1 of the BNLA project in 2013–14, of whom 2009 (83·7%) responded in Wave 2 in 2014–15, 1894 (78·9%) in Wave 3 in 2015–16, and 1929 (80·4%) in Wave 4 in 2016–17. The three most important factors associated with mental health in each wave differed for male and female refugees, but the socioeconomic stressors of loneliness and adjustment to life in Australia were consistently prominent. Positive associations between socioeconomic stressors and mental ill-health were found for both genders, with a peak at Wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] among men, 1·60 [95% CI 1·26–2·03], p=0.0001 for PTSD; AOR 1·86 [1·35–2·55], p=0·0001 for HR-SMI; and among women, AOR 1·81 [1·27–2·57], p=0·0009 for PTSD; AOR 2·24 [1·49–3·38], p=0·0001 for HR-SMI). Associations between loneliness and mental health fluctuated, but were significant for both genders in Wave 4 (among men, AOR 1·90 [1·21–2·99], p=0·0051 for PTSD; AOR 3·70 [2·18–6·27], p<0·0001 for HR-SMI; and among women, AOR 3·65 [2·08–6·39], p<0·0001 for PTSD; AOR 3·68 [2·02–6·69], p<0·0001 for HR-SMI). The association between difficulties in adjustment to life in Australia and male refugees' mental ill-health increased continuously during the resettlement period. Interpretation: Gender-specific and time-sensitive services should be considered to improve refugees' mental health. For both genders, improved economic conditions that complement social security benefits deserve attention and are relevant throughout the resettlement process. At the later stage of resettlement, services to reduce loneliness could be carried out, and reducing stressors related to adjustment to life in the host country is especially needed for male refugees.

Pharmacological intervention in a transgenic mouse model improves Alzheimer's-associated pathological phenotype: Involvement of proteasome activation,/articles/pharmacological-intervention-transgenic-mouse-model-improves-alzheimers-associated,"Proteasome function is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proteasome activation is followed by a decrease in amyloid-beta (Aβ) load. A reduced amount of Aβ correlates with significantly improved behavior and frailty level. Proteasome activation represents a promising intervention for alleviating AD pathology.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide, characterized by a progressive decline in a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive functions. The amyloid beta protein cascade hypothesis places the formation of amyloid beta protein aggregates on the first position in the complex pathological cascade leading to neurodegeneration, and therefore AD might be considered to be a protein-misfolding disease. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS), being the primary protein degradation mechanism with a fundamental role in the maintenance of proteostasis, has been identified as a putative therapeutic target to delay and/or to decelerate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by accumulated/aggregated proteins. The purpose of this study was to test if the activation of proteasome in vivo can alleviate AD pathology. Specifically by using two compounds with complementary modes of proteasome activation and documented antioxidant and redox regulating properties in the 5xFAD transgenic mice model of AD, we ameliorated a number of AD related deficits. Shortly after proteasome activation we detected significantly reduced amyloid-beta load correlated with improved motor functions, reduced anxiety and frailty level. Essentially, to our knowledge this is the first report to demonstrate a dual activation of the proteasome and its downstream effects. In conclusion, these findings open up new directions for future therapeutic potential of proteasome-mediated proteolysis enhancement.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We aimed to provide global, regional, and national estimates of the burden of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer and larynx cancer and their attributable risks from 1990 to 2019. Methods Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 methodology, we evaluated the incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of respiratory tract cancers (ie, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer and larynx cancer). Deaths from tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer and larynx cancer attributable to each risk factor were estimated on the basis of risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level input from 204 countries and territories, stratified by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Trends were estimated from 1990 to 2019, with an emphasis on the 2010-19 period. Findings Globally, there were 2·26 million (95% uncertainty interval 2·07 to 2·45) new cases of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer, and 2·04 million (1·88 to 2·19) deaths and 45·9 million (42·3 to 49·3) DALYs due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer in 2019. There were 209 000 (194 000 to 225 000) new cases of larynx cancer, and 123 000 (115 000 to 133 000) deaths and 3·26 million (3·03 to 3·51) DALYs due to larynx cancer globally in 2019. From 2010 to 2019, the number of new tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer cases increased by 23·3% (12·9 to 33·6) globally and the number of larynx cancer cases increased by 24·7% (16·0 to 34·1) globally. Global age-standardised incidence rates of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer decreased by 7·4% (−16·8 to 1·6) and age-standardised incidence rates of larynx cancer decreased by 3 ·0% (−10·5 to 5·0) in males over the past decade; however, during the same period, age-standardised incidence rates in females increased by 0·9% (−8·2 to 10·2) for tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer and decreased by 0·5% (−8·4 to 8·1) for larynx cancer. Furthermore, although age-standardised incidence and death rates declined in both sexes combined from 2010 to 2019 at the global level for tracheal, bronchus, lung and larynx cancers, some locations had rising rates, particularly those on the lower end of the SDI range. Smoking contributed to an estimated 64·2% (61·9–66·4) of all deaths from tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer and 63·4% (56·3–69·3) of all deaths from larynx cancer in 2019. For males and for both sexes combined, smoking was the leading specific risk factor for age-standardised deaths from tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer per 100 000 in all SDI quintiles and GBD regions in 2019. However, among females, household air pollution from solid fuels was the leading specific risk factor in the low SDI quintile and in three GBD regions (central, eastern, and western sub-Saharan Africa) in 2019. Interpretation The numbers of incident cases and deaths from tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer and larynx cancer increased globally during the past decade. Even more concerning, age-standardised incidence and death rates due to tracheal, bronchus, lung cancer and larynx cancer increased in some populations—namely, in the lower SDI quintiles and among females. Preventive measures such as smoking control interventions, air quality management programmes focused on major air pollution sources, and widespread access to clean energy should be prioritised in these settings.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The focal point for the vulnerability of these people lies in the water resources (drinking water availability, agricultural water quality, salt-water intrusion, flooding etc.) and the future interaction between human and water systems. This paper advocates the importance of socio-hydrological research in the context of enhancing social adaptive capacity as well as for developing a resilient water environment in three very large riverine islands in Asia: Fraserganj (India), Dakshin Bedkashi (Bangladesh) (both from the Ganges-Brahaputra-Meghna Delta) and Con Dao Island (Mekong River, Vietnam).

In light of this, the present study aims to model the effect of climate change on the European electricity system, specifically on its long-term reliability. A resource adequate power system – a system where electricity supply covers demand – is sensitive to generation capacity, demand patterns, and the network structure and capacity. Climate change is foreseen to affect each of these components. In this analysis, we focused on two drivers of power system adequacy: the impact of temperature variations on electricity demand, and of water inflows changes on hydro generation. Using a post-processing approach, based on results found in the literature, the inputs of a large-scale electricity market model covering the European region were modified. The results show that climate change may decrease total LOLE (Loss of Load Expectation) hours in Europe by more than 50%, as demand will largely decrease because of a higher temperatures during winter. We found that the climate change impact on demand tends to decrease LOLE values, while the climate change effects on hydrological conditions tend to increase LOLE values. The study is built on a limited amount of open-source data and can flexibly incorporate various sets of assumptions. Outcomes also show the current difficulties to reliably model the effects of climate change on power system adequacy.

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land,"Land-surface greening has been reported globally over the past decades. While often seen to represent ecosystem recovery, the impacts on biodiversity and society can also be negative. Greening has been widely reported from rangelands, where drivers and processes are complex due to its high environmental heterogeneity and societal dynamics. Here, we assess the complexity behind greening and assess its links to various drivers in an iconic, heterogeneous rangeland area, the Iberá Wetlands and surroundings, in Argentina. Time-series satellite imagery over the past 19 years showed overall net greening, but also substantial local browning both in protected and unprotected areas, linking to land use, temporal changes in surface water, fire, and weather. We found substantial woody expansion mainly in the unprotected land, with 37% contributed by tree plantations and the remaining 63% by spontaneous woody expansion, along with widespread transitions from terrestrial land to seasonal surface water. Fire occurrences tended to reduce greening with unprotected areas experiencing widespread and frequent fire. However, protected areas had more browning in unburnt areas than burned areas. Temporal variation in annual precipitation and temperature tended to nonlinearly influence fire occurrences with an interplay of human fire management, further shaping the vegetation greening, pointing to high complexity behind the observed rangeland greening involving interactions among local drivers. Our findings highlight that the observed overall greening is an outcome of multiple trends with clear negative impacts on biodiversity and the local livestock-oriented culture (notably expanding tree plantations) and spontaneous vegetation dynamics, partly involving spontaneous woody expansion. The latter has positive potential for biodiversity and ecosystem services in terms of woodland recovery, but can become negative in such a natural savanna region if expansions develop on a too broad scale, highlighting the importance of ensuring recovery of natural fire and herbivory regimes in protected areas along with sustainable rangeland management elsewhere.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
Impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on healthcare workers: A nationwide survey of United States radiologists,/articles/impacts-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic-healthcare-workers-nationwide-survey,"Based on the responses of a nationwide survey, this article explores the significant impact that COVID 19 has had on radiologists across the nation and, in the context of SDG 3, the impact on their mental health. ",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Efforts to reduce nosocomial spread of COVID-19 have resulted in unprecedented disruptions in clinical workflows and numerous unexpected stressors for imaging departments across the country. Our purpose was to more precisely evaluate these impacts on radiologists through a nationwide survey. Methods: A 43-item anonymous questionnaire was adapted from the AO Spine Foundation's survey and distributed to 1521 unique email addresses using REDCap™ (Research Electronic Data Capture). Additional invitations were sent out to American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) and Association of University Radiologists (AUR) members. Responses were collected over a period of 8 days. Descriptive analyses and multivariate modeling were performed using SAS v9.4 software. Results: A total of 689 responses from radiologists across 44 different states met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. As many as 61% of respondents rated their level of anxiety with regard to COVID-19 to be a 7 out of 10 or greater, and higher scores were positively correlated the standardized number of COVID-19 cases in a respondent's state (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02–1.21, p = 0.01). Citing the stressor of “personal health” was a strong predictor of higher anxiety scores (RR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.13–1.34, p < 0.01). By contrast, participants who reported needing no coping methods were more likely to self-report lower anxiety scores (RR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3–0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on radiologists across the nation. As these unique stressors continue to evolve, further attention must be paid to the ways in which we may continue to support radiologists working in drastically altered practice environments and in remote settings.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"Owing to their restricted riverine flow and greater numbers, small estuaries (annual discharge < 2000 m3 s−1) are important sites of organic carbon (OC) storage in sediments. The Conwy Estuary is an exemplar small rural-agricultural catchment which delivers a diverse pool of terrestrial OC to the Irish Sea. Thirty-nine surface sediments, covering a distance of 10.5 km, were taken transversal as well as longitudinal to the estuary to examine local and distant catchment inputs. Biomarkers (branched Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers - brGDGTs, n-alkanes) and molecular and bulk proxies (BIT, Paq, TAR, δ13C, C/N), showed sediments were dominated by terrestrial inputs, with only sediments of the three most seaward sites showing stronger physical and geochemical characteristics of a marine influence (e.g., sandier sediments and lower BIT). Biomarker concentrations in the Conwy were comparable to the more urbanised Thames and the Clyde estuaries. The three estuaries showed similar fractional abundance of the brGDGTs, recording an inverse trend between the hexamethylated and the tetramethylated brGDGTs, and showing the pentamethylated brGDGTs as the dominant group. A systematic decrease in terrestrial biomarkers from bank to the main channel confirmed either a strong localised erosion/runoff process or a decrease in water velocity leading to a higher deposition.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: China has a large population of older people, but has not yet undertaken a comprehensive study on the prevalence, risk factors, and management of both dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: For this national cross-sectional study, 46 011 adults aged 60 years or older were recruited between March 10, 2015, and Dec 26, 2018, using a multistage, stratified, cluster-sampling method, which considered geographical region, degree of urbanisation, economic development status, and sex and age distribution. 96 sites were randomly selected in 12 provinces and municipalities representative of all socioeconomic and geographical regions in China. Participants were interviewed to obtain data on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, current medications, and family history, and then completed a neuropsychological testing battery administered by a psychological evaluator. The prevalence of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias) and MCI were calculated and the risk factors for different groups were examined using multivariable-adjusted analyses. Findings: Overall age-adjusted and sex-adjusted prevalence was estimated to be 6·0% (95% CI 5·8–6·3) for dementia, 3·9% (3·8–4·1) for Alzheimer's disease, 1·6% (1·5–1·7) for vascular dementia, and 0·5% (0·5–0·6) for other dementias. We estimated that 15·07 million (95% CI 14·53–15·62) people aged 60 years or older in China have dementia: 9·83 million (9·39–10·29) with Alzheimer's disease, 3·92 million (3·64–4·22) with vascular dementia, and 1·32 million (1·16–1·50) with other dementias. Overall MCI prevalence was estimated to be 15·5% (15·2–15·9), representing 38·77 million (37·95–39·62) people in China. Dementia and MCI shared similar risk factors including old age (dementia: odds ratios ranging from 2·69 [95% CI 2·43–2·98] to 6·60 [5·24–8·32]; MCI: from 1·89 [1·77–2·00] to 4·70 [3·77–5·87]); female sex (dementia: 1·43 [1·31–1·56]; MCI: 1·51 [1·43–1·59]); parental history of dementia (dementia: 7·20 [5·68–9·12]; MCI: 1·91 [1·48–2·46]); rural residence (dementia: 1·16 [1·06–1·27]; MCI: 1·45 [1·38–1·54]); fewer years of education (dementia: from 1·17 [1·06–1·29] to 1·55 [1·38–1·73]; MCI: from 1·48 [1·39–1·58] to 3·48 [3·25–3·73]); being widowed, divorced, or living alone (dementia: from 2·59 [2·30–2·90] to 2·66 [2·29–3·10]; MCI: from 1·58 [1·44–1·73] to 1·74 [1·56–1·95]); smoking (dementia: 1·85 [1·67–2·04]; MCI: 1·27 [1·19–1·36]), hypertension (dementia: 1·86 [1·70–2·03]; MCI: 1·62 [1·54–1·71] for MCI), hyperlipidaemia (dementia: 1·87 [1·71–2·05]; MCI: 1·29 [1·21–1·37]), diabetes (dementia: 2·14 [1·96–2·34]; MCI: 1·44 [1·35–1·53]), heart disease (dementia: 1·98 [1·73–2·26]; MCI: 1·17 [1·06–1·30]), and cerebrovascular disease (dementia: 5·44 [4·95–5·97]; MCI: 1·49 [1·36–1·62]). Nine of these risk factors are modifiable. Interpretation: Dementia and MCI are highly prevalent in China and share similar risk factors. A prevention strategy should be developed to target the identified risk factors in the MCI population to thwart or slow down disease progression. It is also crucial to optimise the management of dementia and MCI as an important part of China's public health system.

In addition, we explored the influence of demographic profile and the characteristics of cases on the conclusions of sexual defense ability. The demographic profile of victims and the characteristics of sexual assault cases were examined. The effects of demographic profile and characteristics of cases on the conclusion of sexual defense ability were analyzed. Among all the victims, 59.4 % were diagnosed with mild intellectual disability.

This study revealed 51.5 % of victims were sexually assaulted more than twice and 80.2 % of offenders knew that the victims had intellectual disability before committing the crime. Victims of mild intellectual disability were more likely to suffered three or more times sexual assaults than those with moderate-severe intellectual disability (χ2 = 8.318, p < 0.05). The more times the victims were sexually assaulted, the higher the level of sexual defense ability(rs = 0.258, P < 0.01).

Plastic pollution solutions: emerging technologies to prevent and collect marine plastic pollution,/articles/plastic-pollution-solutions-emerging-technologies-prevent-and-collect-marine-plastic,Technology can be used to target hotspots of marine plastic pollution. The Inventory is a tool to identify plastic pollution prevention and cleanup technologies.,Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 14: Life below water,"As plastic waste accumulates in the ocean at alarming rates, the need for efficient and sustainable remediation solutions is urgent. One solution is the development and mobilization of technologies that either 1) prevent plastics from entering waterways or 2) collect marine and riverine plastic pollution. To date, however, few reports have focused on these technologies, and information on various technological developments is scattered. This leaves policymakers, innovators, and researchers without a central, comprehensive, and reliable source of information on the status of available technology to target this global problem. The goal of this study was to address this gap by creating a comprehensive inventory of technologies currently used or in development to prevent the the thleakage of plastic pollution or collect existing plastic pollution. Our Plastic Pollution Prevention and Collection Technology Inventory (https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/plastics-technology-inventory) can be used as a roadmap for researchers and governments to 1) facilitate comparisons between the scope of solutions and the breadth and severity of the plastic pollution problem and 2) assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses of current technological approaches. We created this inventory from a systematic search and review of resources that identified technologies. Technologies were organized by the type of technology and target plastics (i.e., macroplastics, microplastic, or both). We identified 52 technologies that fall into the two categories of prevention or collection of plastic pollution. Of these, 59% focus specifically on collecting macroplastic waste already in waterways. While these efforts to collect plastic pollution are laudable, their current capacity and widespread implementation are limited in comparison to their potential and the vast extent of the plastic pollution problem. Similarly, few technologies attempt to prevent plastic pollution leakage, and those that do are limited in scope. A comprehensive approach is needed that combines technology, policymaking, and advocacy to prevent further plastic pollution and the subsequent damage to aquatic ecosystems and human health.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Dementia is associated with a high burden of dependency and disability. Physical frailty (hereafter referred to as frailty) is a multisystem dysregulation that has been identified as a risk factor for dementia. The aim of this study was to examine the association of frailty and its individual components with all-cause dementia incidence in a cohort of UK adults. Methods: Participants in UK Biobank with data available for dementia incidence and without any form of dementia at baseline were included in this prospective study. Frailty was defined using a modified version of the frailty phenotype based on five individual components (weight loss, tiredness, physical activity, gait speed, and grip strength), with participants classified as pre-frail if they fulfilled one or two criteria or frail if they fulfilled three or more. Associations between frailty and dementia incidence were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and morbidity count. The population attributable fraction was also estimated. Findings: Of 502 535 participants in UK Biobank, 143 215 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our analyses. 68 500 (47·8%) of the participants were pre-frail and 5565 (3·9%) were frail. During a median follow-up period of 5·4 years, 726 individuals developed dementia. Compared with non-frail individuals, the risk of dementia incidence was increased for individuals with pre-frailty (hazard ratio 1·21 [95% CI 1·04–1·42]) and frailty (1·98 [1·47–2·67]) in the fully adjusted model. Of the five components used to define frailty, weight loss (1·31 [1·09–1·58]), tiredness (1·48 [1·18–1·86]), low grip strength (1·38 [1·17–1·63]), and slow gait speed (1·55 [1·22–1·96]) were independently associated with incident dementia. Based on population attributable fraction analyses, in the study sample, pre-frailty and frailty accounted for 9·9% and 8·6% of dementia cases, respectively. Interpretation: Individuals with pre-frailty and frailty were at a higher risk of dementia incidence even after adjusting for a wide range of confounding factors.

Plastic pollution is capable of affecting land, waterways and oceans as a large percentage of marine and land creatures have died due to the fact that plastic is non-biodegradable and it causes hazards to soil. It also emits toxic gasses when exposed or heated up. It blocks drainage lines and fill up land space causing floods and erosion thereby causing deterioration of the Nigerian roads. Plastics wastes are also harmful to human health; they may contain harmful acids which may lead to death. Nigeria, which is the biggest oil exporting country in Africa, relies mainly on the proceeds of the oil trade for its GDP and based strategy in growing her economy. However, with the declination of oil prices and increase in plastic wastes, the world is tending towards energy and sustainable development. Therefore, an urgent need for recycling plastic wastes into a solution for wealth creation is fundamental in Nigeria. This paper therefore seeks to identify favorable methods for recycling plastic wastes in Nigeria as a tool for solution to diversification and implementation.

Patients and Methods: A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. Results: Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor.

It is found that sunshine duration has a slightly positive impact on water use. Furthermore, agricultural output will significantly drive agricultural water use based on historical data of the past 16 years. Results also show that carbon reduction would have a trade-off or co-benefit effect on water use due to regional disparity. Provinces with increasing agricultural exports, such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, would anticipate considerable growth in agricultural water use induced by carbon reduction.

"Mapping geographical inequalities in access to drinking water and sanitation facilities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-17",/articles/mapping-geographical-inequalities-access-drinking-water-and-sanitation-facilities-low,"This study supports SDGs 3 and 6 by analysing data from 88 low-income and middle-income countries and showing geographical disparities in access to clean water and sanitation facilities. These findings identify where efforts to increase access to safe water and sanitation have been successful over time, and highlight the need for targeted and tailored interventions to reach those communities and regions that have been left behind. 
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is an essential human right, recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals as crucial for preventing disease and improving human wellbeing. Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. Methods: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. Findings: Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39·4–40·7) to 50·3% (50·0–50·5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46·3% (95% UI 46·1–46·5) in 2017, compared with 28·7% (28·5–29·0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253 000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88·6% (95% UI 87·2–89·7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664–711) of the 1830 (1797–1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76·1% (95% UI 71·6–80·7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53·9% (50·6–59·6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. Interpretation: Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

Plastic pollution in the marine environment,/articles/plastic-pollution-marine-environment,"A good paper to highlight plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem in order to make people aware of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future.
",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 14: Life below water,"Plastic pollution is recognized as a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems across the world. Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness & capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Eradicating food insecurity is necessary for achieving global health goals. Liberal trade policies might increase food supplies but how these policies influence individual-level food insecurity remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between liberal trade policies and food insecurity at the individual level, and whether this association varies across country-income and household-income groups. Methods: For this observational analysis, we combined individual-level data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN with a country-level trade policy index from the Konjunkturforschungsstelle Swiss Economic Institute. We examined the association between a country's trade policy score and the probability of individuals reporting moderate-severe or severe food insecurity using regression models and algorithmic weighting procedures. We controlled for multiple covariates, including gross domestic product, democratisation level, and population size. Additionally, we examined heterogeneity by country and household income. Results: Our sample comprised 460 102 individuals in 132 countries for the period of 2014–17. Liberal trade policy was not significantly associated with moderate-severe or severe food insecurity after covariate adjustment. However, among households in high-income countries with incomes higher than US$25 430 per person per year (adjusted for purchasing power parity), a unit increase in the trade policy index (more liberal) corresponded to a 0·07% (95% CI −0·10 to −0·04) reduction in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. Among households in the lowest income decile (<$450 per person per year) in low-income countries, a unit increase in the trade policy index was associated with a 0·35% (0·06 to 0·60) increase in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. Interpretation: The relationship between liberal trade policy and food insecurity varied across countries and households. Liberal trade policy was predominantly associated with lower food insecurity in high-income countries but corresponded to increased food insecurity among the world's poorest households in low-income countries.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Brazil ranks second worldwide in total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indígeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings: Of 99 557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11 321 patients in our study. 9278 (82·0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18·0%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·45, 95% CI 1·33–1·58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1·32, 1·15–1·52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. Interpretation: We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

Achieving coordinated national immunity and cholera elimination in Haiti through vaccination: a modelling study,/articles/achieving-coordinated-national-immunity-and-cholera-elimination-haiti-through-vaccination,"This study supports SDGs 3 and 6 by suggesting that current methods of cholera control are insufficient at achieving zero transmission of Vibrio cholerae in Haiti, and that large-scale cholera vaccination campaigns are needed alongside improvements in water and sanitation for long-term cholera elimination.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Cholera was introduced into Haiti in 2010. Since then, more than 820 000 cases and nearly 10 000 deaths have been reported. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is safe and effective, but has not been seen as a primary tool for cholera elimination due to a limited period of protection and constrained supplies. Regionally, epidemic cholera is contained to the island of Hispaniola, and the lowest numbers of cases since the epidemic began were reported in 2019. Hence, Haiti may represent a unique opportunity to eliminate cholera with OCV. Methods: In this modelling study, we assessed the probability of elimination, time to elimination, and percentage of cases averted with OCV campaign scenarios in Haiti through simulations from four modelling teams. For a 10-year period from January 19, 2019, to Jan 13, 2029, we compared a no vaccination scenario with five OCV campaign scenarios that differed in geographical scope, coverage, and rollout duration. Teams used weekly department-level reports of suspected cholera cases from the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population to calibrate the models and used common vaccine-related assumptions, but other model features were determined independently. Findings: Among campaigns with the same vaccination coverage (70% fully vaccinated), the median probability of elimination after 5 years was 0–18% for no vaccination, 0–33% for 2-year campaigns focused in the two departments with the highest historical incidence, 0–72% for three-department campaigns, and 35–100% for nationwide campaigns. Two-department campaigns averted a median of 12–58% of infections, three-department campaigns averted 29–80% of infections, and national campaigns averted 58–95% of infections. Extending the national campaign to a 5-year rollout (compared to a 2-year rollout), reduced the probability of elimination to 0–95% and the proportion of cases averted to 37–86%. Interpretation: Models suggest that the probability of achieving zero transmission of Vibrio cholerae in Haiti with current methods of control is low, and that bolder action is needed to promote elimination of cholera from the region. Large-scale cholera vaccination campaigns in Haiti would offer the opportunity to synchronise nationwide immunity, providing near-term population protection while improvements to water and sanitation promote long-term cholera elimination.

Net benefit and cost-effectiveness of universal iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders for young children in 78 countries: a microsimulation study,/articles/net-benefit-and-cost-effectiveness-universal-iron-containing-multiple-micronutrient-powders,"An Article in support of SDGs 2 and 3, analysing the effectiveness of multiple micronutrient powders in infants and showing net health benefits of this intervention in most countries, although cost-effectiveness varied in different settings.
",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Universal home fortification of complementary foods with iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) is a key intervention to prevent anaemia in young children in low-income and middle-income countries. However, evidence that MNPs might promote infection raises uncertainty about whether MNPs give net health benefits and are cost-effective. We aimed to determined country-specific net benefit or harm and cost-effectiveness of universal provision of MNPs to children aged 6 months. Methods: We developed a microsimulation model to estimate net country-specific disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) due to anaemia, malaria, and diarrhoea averted (or increased) by provision of a 6-month course of MNPs to children aged 6 months, compared with no intervention, who would be followed up for an additional 6 months (ie, to age 18 months). Anaemia prevalence was derived from Demographic and Health Surveys or similar national surveys, and malaria and diarrhoea incidence were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Programme and health-care costs were modelled to determine cost per DALY averted (US$). Additionally, we explored the effects of reduced MNP coverage in a sensitivity analysis. Findings: 78 countries (46 countries in Africa, 20 in Asia or the Middle East, and 12 in Latin America) were included in the analysis, and we simulated 5 million children per country. 6 months of universal distribution of daily MNPs, assuming 100% coverage, produced a net benefit (DALYs averted) in 54 countries (24 in Africa, 19 in Asia and the Middle East, 11 in Latin America) and net harm in 24 countries (22 in Africa, one in Asia, and one in Latin America). MNP intervention provided a benefit on YLDs associated with anaemia, but these gains were attenuated and sometimes reversed by increases in YLLs associated with malaria and diarrhoea, reducing the benefits seen for DALYs. In the 54 countries where MNP provision was beneficial, the median benefit was 28·1 DALYs averted per 10 000 children receiving MNPs (IQR 20·6–40·4), and median cost per DALY averted was $3576 (IQR 2474–4918). DALY effects positively correlated with moderate and severe anaemia prevalence in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, but correlated inversely in Africa. Suboptimal coverage markedly reduced DALYs averted and cost-effectiveness. Interpretation: Net health benefits of MNPs vary between countries, are highest where prevalence of moderate and severe anaemia is greatest but infection prevalence is smallest, and are ameliorated when coverage of the intervention is poor. Our data provide country-specific guidance to national policy makers. Funding: International Union of Nutrition Sciences.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, the age-specific incidence of dementia has fallen in many countries, probably because of improvements in education, nutrition, health care, and lifestyle changes. Overall, a growing body of evidence supports the nine potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia modelled by the 2017 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care: less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, and low social contact. We now add three more risk factors for dementia with newer, convincing evidence. These factors are excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution. We have completed new reviews and meta-analyses and incorporated these into an updated 12 risk factor life-course model of dementia prevention. Together the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40% of worldwide dementias, which consequently could theoretically be prevented or delayed.

Advanced glycation end products and protein carbonyl levels in plasma reveal sex-specific differences in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease,/articles/advanced-glycation-end-products-and-protein-carbonyl-levels-plasma-reveal-sex-specific,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are distinct clinical entities; however, the aggregation of key neuronal proteins, presumably leading to neuronal demise appears to represent a common mechanism. It has become evident that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) trigger the accumulation of such modified proteins, which eventually contributes to the pathological aspect of NDDs. Increased levels of AGEs are found in amyloid plaques in AD brains and in both advanced and early PD (incidental Lewy body disease). The molecular mechanisms by which AGE dependent modifications may modulate the susceptibility towards NDDs, however, remain enigmatic and it is unclear whether AGEs may serve as biomarker of NDD.

A somewhat similar pattern was observed for protein carbonyls (PC), revealing lower values exclusively in AD females, whereas AD males displayed significantly higher values compared to healthy controls and PD. Sex-specific differences were also observed for other relevant markers such as malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, γ -tocopherols, retinol, plasma proteins and α-carotene, while α-tocopherols, β-carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and lycopene showed no relevant association.

The results showed the top limit of payments was 1,080.95 CNY/year/capita on average, and people would like to pay 172.40 CNY/year/capita for water conservation, which is the highest among the six ES. The percent of people “Aged 16–35”, “Government agency staff” and “Know WTP” influenced payments at provincial level. On an individual level, people's knowledge and attitudes directly drove the payment amounts, as well as their ecosystem management decisions.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Alzheimer's disease and its complications are the leading cause of death in adults with Down syndrome. Studies have assessed Alzheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome, but the natural history of biomarker changes in Down syndrome has not been established. We characterised the order and timing of changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in a population of adults with Down syndrome. Methods: We did a dual-centre cross-sectional study of adults with Down syndrome recruited through a population-based health plan in Barcelona (Spain) and through services for people with intellectual disabilities in Cambridge (UK). Cognitive impairment in participants with Down syndrome was classified with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome (CAMCOG-DS). Only participants with mild or moderate disability were included who had at least one of the following Alzheimer's disease measures: apolipoprotein E allele carrier status; plasma concentrations of amyloid β peptides 1–42 and 1–40 and their ratio (Aβ1–42/1–40), total tau protein, and neurofilament light chain (NFL); tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), and NFL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); and one or more of PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, PET with amyloid tracers, and MRI. Cognitively healthy euploid controls aged up to 75 years who had no biomarker abnormalities were recruited from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration. We used a first-order locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve to determine the order and age at onset of the biomarker changes, and the lowest ages at the divergence with 95% CIs are also reported where appropriate. Findings: Between Feb 1, 2013, and June 28, 2019 (Barcelona), and between June 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2014 (Cambridge), we included 388 participants with Down syndrome (257 [66%] asymptomatic, 48 [12%] with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and 83 [21%] with Alzheimer's disease dementia) and 242 euploid controls. CSF Aβ1–42/1–40 and plasma NFL values changed in individuals with Down syndrome as early as the third decade of life, and amyloid PET uptake changed in the fourth decade. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and CSF p-tau changes occurred later in the fourth decade of life, followed by hippocampal atrophy and changes in cognition in the fifth decade of life. Prodromal Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed at a median age of 50·2 years (IQR 47·5–54·1), and Alzheimer's disease dementia at 53·7 years (49·5–57·2). Symptomatic Alzheimer's disease prevalence increased with age in individuals with Down syndrome, reaching 90–100% in the seventh decade of life. Interpretation: Alzheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome has a long preclinical phase in which biomarkers follow a predictable order of changes over more than two decades. The similarities with sporadic and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and the prevalence of Down syndrome make this population a suitable target for Alzheimer's disease preventive treatments.

The non-woven geotextiles as strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on glaciers,/articles/non-woven-geotextiles-strategies-mitigating-impacts-climate-change-glaciers,The non-woven geotextiles are able to reduce snow/ice melt up to 69% compared to the uncovered glacier surface.,Goal 13: Climate action,"During the past decades, there have been attempts to offset melt at glacier ski resorts. The most important method is active glacier protection, largely based on the use of geotextiles to preserve snow cover and reduce its melt. Until 2008, a scientific evaluation of the efficiency of glacier covering strategies had never been carried out in Italy, although strategies for snow melt reduction were already in place. In this study, we show the results from three experiments carried out on Dosdè Est Glacier (Cima Piazzi Group, Lombardy) and Presena Ovest Glacier (Adamello-Presanella Group, Autonomous Province of Trento). The first experiment was set up in 2008 at 2800 m a.s.l. on Dosdè Est Glacier with the aim of verifying the applicability and the effectiveness of these geotextile covers on non-groomed snow. The second test was carried out in 2010 by covering most of Presena Ovest Glacier with the aim of verifying the applicability and the effectiveness of geotextile covers on groomed snow and of investigating the involved radiative processes. The last experiment was set up in 2012 at 2765 m a.s.l. on Presena Ovest Glacier and it was aimed at evaluating which materials and properties are able to reduce snow/ice melt more effectively. Tested materials included commonly used polypropylene and polyester and poly-lactic acid (fully biodegradable) with different combinations of mass per unit area and thickness. We found that these non-woven geotextiles are able to reduce snow/ice melt up to 69% compared to the uncovered glacier surface, mainly thanks to an increase in albedo by about 50% compared to ice.

These findings highlight the need for system-wide and structural interventions to reduce the risk of diabetes and gestational diabetes in Indigenous women before, during, and after pregnancy. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: Indigenous peoples in countries with similar colonial histories have disproportionate burdens of disease compared with non-Indigenous peoples. We aimed to systematically identify and collate studies describing the prevalence of pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes, and compare the prevalence of these conditions between Indigenous and non-Indigenous pregnant women in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the USA. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, an information specialist did a comprehensive search of eight databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Global Health, CINAHL [EBSCO], Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, PROSPERO, and the Wiley Cochrane Library) in June, 2019, for studies published between inception and June 25, 2019, without restrictions on language, publication type, or year of publication. Database searches were supplemented by grey literature searches of the Bielefield Academic Search Engine and Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant articles were also manually searched. We included observational epidemiological studies comparing the prevalence of pre-existing diabetes or gestational diabetes in Indigenous and non-Indigenous pregnant women in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the USA. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and risk of bias. We used a standardised data extraction form to collect information from the published reports of eligible studies, and, if needed, we contacted authors for further information. We did a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects meta-analysis to obtain the pooled unadjusted prevalence odds ratios (PORs) of pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes in Indigenous women compared with non-Indigenous women. We stratified meta-analyses by country and type of diabetes. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018095971. Findings: Our search identified 1348 studies, of which 43 studies with 32 952 441 participants from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the USA were included in the systematic review, and 39 of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. 40 of the included studies used a cohort design. Pre-existing diabetes was more prevalent in Indigenous women than in non-Indigenous women, with pooled PORs ranging from 1·81 (95% CI 1·53–2·13) for women in the USA to 3·63 (2·35–5·62) for women in Australia. Similarly, gestational diabetes was more prevalent in Indigenous women than in non-Indigenous women, with PORs ranging from 1·42 (1·24–1·63) for women in Australia to 2·04 (1·46–2·84) for women in Canada. Risk of bias was low in 37·2% of studies, unclear in 34·8% of studies, and high in 27·9% of studies. Heterogeneity between studies was predominantly high (I2=97–100%), with one exception of moderate heterogeneity (I2=48%); however, the magnitude and direction of the PORs from individual studies indicated an association between pre-existing diabetes or gestational diabetes and indigeneity among pregnant women. Interpretation: The prevalence of pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes was higher in Indigenous pregnant women than in non-Indigenous pregnant women in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA) with similar histories of colonialism.

The recent momentum towards electric vehicles and the renewable energy storage market is creating an increased demand for LIBs. The large amount of hazardous waste generated from the disposal of LIBs is driving research into a sustainable approach for LIB treatment and recovery. The positive electrode active materials being the main targeted component as it is the greatest cost contributor to LIBs production. During the production of the positive electrode, a powder of active material typically Lithium Cobalt Oxide is applied to aluminium foil and held together using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. The recovery of positive electrode active material involves physical and chemical treatment. Where effective and efficient physical treatment would reduce the cost incurred for the subsequent chemical treatment. Mechanical treatment is an integral part of liberating and concentrating positive electrode active material. The positive electrode active materials have been reported are being concentrated in the finer size region. However, the cut point at which the positive electrode active material being concentrated is substantially greater than the size of the positive electrode active material particle size as found in spent LIBs. This paper studies the characteristics of milled spent LIBs concerning particle size. The results suggest that a cut point of 850 μm gives the best composition of the positive electrode active materials recovery that minimises the involvement of copper and aluminium. However, most of the active materials are still held together by the PVDF binder that creates a substantially higher cut point proposed that the actual size of the positive electrode active material contained within spent LIBs. The interaction of copper and aluminium current collector based on size also further discussed in this paper.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background and aim: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare chronic form of hepatitis, the prognosis for which has not been definitively established. The current study aimed to define the prognostic factors for remission and compare the median time to remission, complications, and relapse rate between type 1 AIH patients treated with prednisolone monotherapy and those treated using prednisolone in combination with azathioprine. Materials and methods: The data of 86 patients diagnosed with type 1 AIH between January 1998 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, serological, and histological parameters were obtained. Cox-proportional hazard and logistic regression analyses were applied to the data. Results: The prognostic factors related to complete remission were absence of liver cirrhosis, hypertension, and azathioprine exposure. The median time to complete remission of the prednisolone group (92 days; 95%CI; 65–264 days) was significantly shorter (P = 0.01) than that of the combination group (336 days; 95%CI; 161–562 days); however, the prednisolone group had higher rates of treatment complications—including skin and soft tissue infections (P = 0.010) and cushingoid appearance (P = 0.011)—than the combination group.

Prediction of dementia risk in low-income and middle-income countries (the 10/66 Study): an independent external validation of existing models,/articles/prediction-dementia-risk-low-income-and-middle-income-countries-1066-study-independent,"An article in support of SDG 3, assessing whether and to what extent existing dementia prevention models developed in high-income countries can be extrapolated to low-income and middle-income countries, where dementia risk prediction research is almost non-existent.
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: To date, dementia prediction models have been exclusively developed and tested in high-income countries (HICs). However, most people with dementia live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where dementia risk prediction research is almost non-existent and the ability of current models to predict dementia is unknown. This study investigated whether dementia prediction models developed in HICs are applicable to LMICs. Methods: Data were from the 10/66 Study. Individuals aged 65 years or older and without dementia at baseline were selected from China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. Dementia incidence was assessed over 3–5 years, with diagnosis according to the 10/66 Study diagnostic algorithm. Discrimination and calibration were tested for five models: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia risk score (CAIDE); the Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia (AgeCoDe) model; the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI); the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI); and the Rotterdam Study Basic Dementia Risk Model (BDRM). Models were tested with use of Cox regression. The discriminative accuracy of each model was assessed using Harrell's concordance (c)-statistic, with a value of 0·70 or higher considered to indicate acceptable discriminative ability. Calibration (model fit) was assessed statistically using the Grønnesby and Borgan test. Findings: 11 143 individuals without baseline dementia and with available follow-up data were included in the analysis. During follow-up (mean 3·8 years [SD 1·3]), 1069 people progressed to dementia across all sites (incidence rate 24·9 cases per 1000 person-years). Performance of the models varied. Across countries, the discriminative ability of the CAIDE (0·52≤c≤0·63) and AgeCoDe (0·57≤c≤0·74) models was poor. By contrast, the ANU-ADRI (0·66≤c≤0·78), BDSI (0·62≤c≤0·78), and BDRM (0·66≤c≤0·78) models showed similar levels of discriminative ability to those of the development cohorts. All models showed good calibration, especially at low and intermediate levels of predicted risk. The models validated best in Peru and poorest in the Dominican Republic and China. Interpretation: Not all dementia prediction models developed in HICs can be simply extrapolated to LMICs. Further work defining what number and which combination of risk variables works best for predicting risk of dementia in LMICs is needed. However, models that transport well could be used immediately for dementia prevention research and targeted risk reduction in LMICs.

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land,"Agricultural landscapes cultivated in hilly and mountainous areas, often with terracing practice, could represent for some regions historical heritages and cultural ecosystem services. For this reason, they deserve to be protected. The complex morphology that characterises them, however, makes these areas intrinsically susceptible to hydrogeological instability, such as soil loss due to surface erosion or more severe mass movements. We can identify three major critical factors for such landscapes. The first is related to the socio-economic evolution of contemporary civilization, that increased the land abandonment of several rural regions, leading therefore to a lack of maintenance. A second element is the unsustainable agricultural practices, such as excessive heavy-mechanization that cause soil compaction thus accelerating degradation. Finally, the climate change forcing, with the increasing of the extreme rainfall. In this complex framework, it is necessary to find innovative solutions for the mitigation of hydrogeological risk and to respond in a well-prepared way to the possible future critical scenarios. Therefore, the use of sustainable agricultural practices, which allow the production of quality agricultural products in perfect harmony with the surrounding environment, becomes crucial. Suitable solutions must respond to the criterion of multidisciplinary, where the various stakeholders collaborate by offering their specific knowledge in a shared intention of problem-solving. The discipline of geography may become a valuable asset in this framework. In particular, thanks to the recent technological advances in the topographic survey (e.g. innovative remote sensing techniques such as drones and airborne laser scanning), it is possible to exploit digital terrain analysis to synthesize key information for decision-makers, in order to plan sustainable interventions. Moreover, thanks to the high-resolution and accuracy offered by digital topography and the advanced morphometric algorithms, it is possible to tackle the problem of hydrogeological risk from a unique and privileged perspective: that of prevention.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) in croplands is a key property of soil quality for ensuring food security and agricultural sustainability, and also plays a central role in the global carbon (C) budget. When managed sustainably, soils may play a critical role in mitigating climate change by sequestering C and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. However, the magnitude and spatio-temporal patterns of global cropland SOC are far from well constrained due to high land surface heterogeneity, complicated mechanisms, and multiple influencing factors. Here, we use a process-based agroecosystem model (DLEM-Ag) in combination with diverse spatially-explicit gridded environmental data to quantify the long-term trend of SOC storage in global cropland area during 1901-2010 and identify the relative impacts of climate change, elevated CO2, nitrogen deposition, land cover change, and land management practices such as nitrogen fertilizer use and irrigation. Model results show that the total SOC and SOC density in the 2000s increased by 125% and 48.8%, respectively, compared to the early 20th century. This SOC increase was primarily attributed to cropland expansion and nitrogen fertilizer use. Factorial analysis suggests that climate change reduced approximately 3.2% (or 2,166 Tg C) of the total SOC over the past 110 years. Our results indicate that croplands have a large potential to sequester C through implementing better land use management practices, which may partially offset SOC loss caused by climate change.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

",Goal 13: Climate action; Goal 15: Life on land; Goal 17: Partnership for the goals,"Fire is a major type of disturbance that has important influences on ecosystem dynamics and carbon cycles. Yet our understanding of ecosystem fires and their carbon cycle consequences is still limited, largely due to the difficulty of large-scale fire monitoring and the complex interactions between fire, vegetation, climate, and anthropogenic factors. Here, using data from satellite-derived fire observations and ecosystem model simulations, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of China's ecosystem fire disturbances and their carbon emissions over the past two decades (1997–2016). Satellite-derived results showed that on average about 3.47 - 4.53 × 104 km2 of the land was burned annually during the past two decades, among which annual burned forest area was about 0.81 - 1.25 × 104 km2, accounting for 0.33-0.51% of the forest area in China. Biomass burning emitted about 23.02 TgC per year. Compared to satellite products, simulations from the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM) strongly overestimated China's burned area and fire-induced carbon emissions. Annual burned area and fire-induced carbon emissions were high for boreal forest in Northeast China's Daxing'anling region and subtropical dry forest in South Yunnan, as revealed by both the satellite product and the model simulations. Our results suggest that climate and anthropogenic factors play critical roles in controlling the spatial and seasonal distribution of China's ecosystem fire disturbances. Our findings highlight the importance of multiple complementary approaches in assessing ecosystem fire disturbance and its carbon consequences.

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 4: Quality education; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Objectives: Te Tiriti o Waitangi is foundational to health policy in Aotearoa (New Zealand). Systemic breaches of te Tiriti have contributed to enduring health inequities between Māori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand) and other New Zealanders. There are significant inequities in cancer morbidity and mortality rates between Māori and non-Māori. With the development of a new Cancer Control Strategy underway in Aotearoa it is timely to critically review the current Strategy with a view to strengthen efforts to minimise the harm of cancer through stronger alignment to te Tiriti responsibilities. Design: Within this paper the authors undertake a critical Tiriti analysis of the current New Zealand Cancer Control Strategy. This process involves interrogating the policy against the preamble, and the articles of the Māori text of te Tiriti; focussing on kāwanatanga (governance), tino Rangatiratanga (sovereignty), ōritetanga (equity) and wairuatanga (spirituality). Results: We found that the Strategy contained little tangible connection to te Tiriti or other Māori health strategic documents. The significance of such a gap can be clearly seen in the continuing inequities of access and outcomes for Māori with cancer. Conclusions: We recommend that future cancer control strategies in Aotearoa be developed with te Tiriti and tikanga (Māori protocols) as the central considerations.

Association between ethnicity and under-5 mortality: analysis of data from demographic surveys from 36 low-income and middle-income countries,/articles/association-between-ethnicity-and-under-5-mortality-analysis-data-demographic-surveys-36,"This study supports SDG 3 and 10 by analysing data from 415 ethnic groups in 36 low-income and middle-income countries, and showing substantial ethnic disparities in under-5 mortality across the countries studied. These findings are crucial for monitoring trends and examining the impact of health interventions on child survival across different ethnic groups. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"Background: The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for stratification of social indicators by ethnic groups; however, no recent multicountry analyses on ethnicity and child survival have been done in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys collected between 2010 and 2016, from LMICs that provided birth histories and information on ethnicity or a proxy variable. We calculated neonatal (age 0–27 days), post-neonatal (age 28–364 days), child (age 1–4 years), and under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) for each ethnic group within each country. We assessed differences in mortality between ethnic groups using a likelihood ratio test, Theil's index, and between-group variance. We used multivariable analyses of U5MR by ethnicity to adjust for household wealth, maternal education, and urban–rural residence. Findings: We included data from 36 LMICs, which included 2 812 381 livebirths among 415 ethnic groups. In 25 countries, significant differences in U5MR by ethnic group were identified (all p<0·05 likelihood ratio test). In these countries, the median mortality ratio between the ethnic groups with the highest and lowest U5MRs was 3·3 (IQR 2·1–5·2; range 1·5–8·5), whereas among the remaining 11 countries, the median U5MR ratio was 1·9 (IQR 1·7–2·5; range 1·4–10·0). Ethnic gaps were wider for child mortality than for neonatal or post-neonatal mortality. In nearly all countries, adjustment for wealth, education, and place of residence did not affect ethnic gaps in mortality, with the exception of Guatemala, India, Laos, and Nigeria. The largest ethnic group did not have the lowest U5MR in any of the countries studied. Interpretation: Significant ethnic disparities in child survival were identified in more than two-thirds of the countries studied. Regular analyses of ethnic disparities are essential for monitoring trends, targeting, and assessing the impact of health interventions. Such analyses will contribute to the effort towards leaving no one behind, which is at the centre of the SDGs.

This study investigated whether total PA and PA domains of leisure time, commuting and occupational PA and screen time sitting at home were associated with PMH. Methods: The study used a national population study, the FinHealth 2017 Study that included the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) as a measurement for PMH. Of all (n = 10305, of whom 10247 were eligible) invited, 58.1% (5952) participated in health examination and were given a questionnaire including the WEMWBS. A total of 5337 (52.1% of the eligible sample, 89.7% of the health examination participants) returned the questionnaire. The WEMWBS scale was adequately completed by 5090 participants (55.6% women, mean age 55.5 years). Low, moderate and high level of PMH categories were formed. Leisure time, occupational and commuting PA domains were assessed separately and together as a total PA index. Also, screen time sitting at home was measured. Binary logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the odds ratios for having low PMH compared with moderate PMH and separately for having high PMH compared with moderate PMH. The models were estimated both with and without adjustment for potential confounders. Results: Physical inactivity (total PA) was associated with lower levels of PMH. Some of the PA domains were strongly associated with low PMH; leisure time physical inactivity and long screen time sitting at home were strongly related to higher odds of low PMH. Commuting PA was associated with high PMH. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of PA with relation to PMH among adults. Especially, physical inactivity was strongly associated with low PMH. As low levels of PMH can potentially present a risk for mental ill-health, this study suggests it is important to increase PA among the least active population.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An assessment of groundwater use in irrigated agriculture using multi-spectral remote sensing,/articles/assessment-groundwater-use-irrigated-agriculture-using-multi-spectral-remote-sensing,"The use of crop evapotranspiration data has allowed the estimation of crop water requirements and consumptive groundwater use.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Declining water resources in dry regions requires sustainable groundwater management as trends indicate increasing groundwater use, but without accountability. The sustainability of groundwater is uncertain, as little is known about its extent and availability, a challenge that requires a quantitative assessment of its current use. This study assessed groundwater use for irrigated agriculture in the Venda-Gazankulu area of Limpopo Province in South Africa using crop evapotranspiration and irrigated crop area derived from the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Evapotranspiration data was derived from the Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed Actual Evapotranspiration and Interception (WaPOR) dataset (250 m resolution), and irrigated areas were characterised using dry season NDVI data derived from Landsat 8. Field surveys were conducted for four years to assess accuracy and for post-classification correction. Daily ET for the dry season (May to September) was developed from the actual ET for the irrigated areas. The irrigated areas were overlaid on the ET map to calculate ET for only irrigated land parcels. Groundwater use during the 2015 dry period was 3627.49 billion m3 and the irrigated area during the same period was 26% of cultivated land. About 82 435 ha of cultivated area was irrigated using 44 million m3/ha of water, compared to 186.93 million m3/ha on a rainfed area of 237 847 ha.

",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Azerbaijan are based on the principles of innovative management and this trend is the basis of transition to a sustainable green economy. In this regard, sustainable water management become one of the most important factors to build an inclusive society and to achieve sustainable management in state. National Program for Sustainable Socio-Economic Development in Azerbaijan covers the periods of 2004-–2018, 2018–2025. One of the sections of the Program is fully devoted to water policy issues. At the present stage, for the sustainable development of the region, it is necessary to ensure the country's water safety by improving the efficiency of water management and consumption. In this paper my objective is to analyze the water management in Azerbaijan. In particular, the degree of efficiency of the institutions and the tariff structure to give recommendations for future development. I argue that public policy should be focused on identifying those factors that seek effective management of water resources, uncover several laws, ensuring sustainable development. Furthermore, I take into account that in order to achieve sustainable management an integrated approach to the urban water supply, irrigation needs, industry, water tariffs and its secondary use, the impact of water on export potential is key factor. Finally, I analyzed transboundary water cooperation within regional context as Azerbaijan, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Azerbaijan-EU and Azerbaijan-UN partnership on the water field.

Affordability of the EAT–Lancet reference diet: a global analysis,/articles/affordability-eat%E2%80%93lancet-reference-diet-global-analysis,"An Article in support of SDGs 2 and 12, analysing the affordability of the EAT–Lancet benchmark diets using food price and household income data for 744 foods in 159 countries, collected under the International Comparison Program.
",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production,"Background: The EAT–Lancet Commission drew on all available nutritional and environmental evidence to construct the first global benchmark diet capable of sustaining health and protecting the planet, but it did not assess dietary affordability. We used food price and household income data to estimate affordability of EAT–Lancet benchmark diets, as a first step to guiding interventions to improve diets around the world. Methods: We obtained retail prices from 2011 for 744 foods in 159 countries, collected under the International Comparison Program. We used these data to identify the most affordable foods to meet EAT–Lancet targets. We compared total diet cost per day to each country's mean per capita household income, calculated the proportion of people for whom the most affordable EAT–Lancet diet exceeds total income, and also measured affordability relative to a least-cost diet that meets essential nutrient requirements. Findings: The most affordable EAT–Lancet diets cost a global median of US$2·84 per day (IQR 2·41–3·16) in 2011, of which the largest share was the cost of fruits and vegetables (31·2%), followed by legumes and nuts (18·7%), meat, eggs, and fish (15·2%), and dairy (13·2%). This diet costs a small fraction of average incomes in high-income countries but is not affordable for the world's poor. We estimated that the cost of an EAT–Lancet diet exceeded household per capita income for at least 1·58 billion people. The EAT–Lancet diet is also more expensive than the minimum cost of nutrient adequacy, on average, by a mean factor of 1·60 (IQR 1·41–1·78). Interpretation: Current diets differ greatly from EAT–Lancet targets. Improving diets is affordable in many countries but for many people would require some combination of higher income, nutritional assistance, and lower prices. Data and analysis for the cost of healthier foods are needed to inform both local interventions and systemic changes.

The interplay between redox signalling and proteostasis in neurodegeneration: In vivo effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant in Huntington's disease mice,/articles/interplay-between-redox-signalling-and-proteostasis-neurodegeneration-vivo-effects,"Abnormal protein homeostasis (proteostasis), dysfunctional mitochondria, and aberrant redox signalling are often associated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's (HD), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It remains incompletely understood, however, how changes in redox signalling affect proteostasis mechanisms, including protein degradation pathways and unfolded protein responses (UPR). This article addresses this open question by investigating the interplay between redox signalling and proteostasis in a mouse model of HD, and by examining the in vivo effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ. ",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Abnormal protein homeostasis (proteostasis), dysfunctional mitochondria, and aberrant redox signalling are often associated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's (HD), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It remains incompletely understood, however, how changes in redox signalling affect proteostasis mechanisms, including protein degradation pathways and unfolded protein responses (UPR). Here we address this open question by investigating the interplay between redox signalling and proteostasis in a mouse model of HD, and by examining the in vivo effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ. We performed behavioural tests in wild-type and R6/2 HD mice, examined markers of oxidative stress, UPR activation, and the status of key protein degradation pathways in brain and peripheral tissues. We show that R6/2 mice present widespread markers of oxidative stress, with tissue-specific changes in proteostasis that were more pronounced in the brain and muscle than in the liver. R6/2 mice presented increased levels of cytosolic and mitochondrial chaperones, particularly in muscle, indicating UPR activation. Treatment with MitoQ significantly ameliorated fine motor control of R6/2 mice, and reduced markers of oxidative damage in muscle. Additionally, MitoQ attenuated overactive autophagy induction in the R6/2 muscle, which has been associated with muscle wasting. Treatment with MitoQ did not alter autophagy markers in the brain, in agreement with its low brain bioavailability, which limits the risk of impairing neuronal protein clearance mechanisms. This study supports the hypotheses that abnormal redox signalling in muscle contributes to altered proteostasis and motor impairment in HD, and that redox interventions can improve muscle performance, highlighting the importance of peripheral therapeutics in HD.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 2: Zero hunger; Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Malnutrition is a major contributor to disease burden in India. To inform subnational action, we aimed to assess the disease burden due to malnutrition and the trends in its indicators in every state of India in relation to Indian and global nutrition targets. Methods: We analysed the disease burden attributable to child and maternal malnutrition, and the trends in the malnutrition indicators from 1990 to 2017 in every state of India using all accessible data from multiple sources, as part of Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. The states were categorised into three groups using their Socio-demographic Index (SDI) calculated by GBD on the basis of per capita income, mean education, and fertility rate in women younger than 25 years. We projected the prevalence of malnutrition indicators for the states of India up to 2030 on the basis of the 1990–2017 trends for comparison with India National Nutrition Mission (NNM) 2022 and WHO and UNICEF 2030 targets. Findings: Malnutrition was the predominant risk factor for death in children younger than 5 years of age in every state of India in 2017, accounting for 68·2% (95% UI 65·8–70·7) of the total under-5 deaths, and the leading risk factor for health loss for all ages, responsible for 17·3% (16·3–18·2) of the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The malnutrition DALY rate was much higher in the low SDI than in the middle SDI and high SDI state groups. This rate varied 6·8 times between the states in 2017, and was highest in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, and Rajasthan. The prevalence of low birthweight in India in 2017 was 21·4% (20·8–21·9), child stunting 39·3% (38·7–40·1), child wasting 15·7% (15·6–15·9), child underweight 32·7% (32·3–33·1), anaemia in children 59·7% (56·2–63·8), anaemia in women 15–49 years of age 54·4% (53·7–55·2), exclusive breastfeeding 53·3% (51·5–54·9), and child overweight 11·5% (8·5–14·9). If the trends estimated up to 2017 for the indicators in the NNM 2022 continue in India, there would be 8·9% excess prevalence for low birthweight, 9·6% for stunting, 4·8% for underweight, 11·7% for anaemia in children, and 13·8% for anaemia in women relative to the 2022 targets. For the additional indicators in the WHO and UNICEF 2030 targets, the trends up to 2017 would lead to 10·4% excess prevalence for wasting, 14·5% excess prevalence for overweight, and 10·7% less exclusive breastfeeding in 2030. The prevalence of malnutrition indicators, their rates of improvement, and the gaps between projected prevalence and targets vary substantially between the states. Interpretation: Malnutrition continues to be the leading risk factor for disease burden in India. It is encouraging that India has set ambitious targets to reduce malnutrition through NNM. The trends up to 2017 indicate that substantially higher rates of improvement will be needed for all malnutrition indicators in most states to achieve the Indian 2022 and the global 2030 targets. The state-specific findings in this report indicate the effort needed in each state, which will be useful in tracking and motivating further progress.

No single biomarker can by itself accurately diagnose AD. A combination of biomarkers assessed through imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) yields better diagnostic accuracy. Although amyloid PET imaging and CSF levels of amyloid and tau deposits are increasingly used in AD clinical trials to increase diagnostic confidence in enrolled subjects, routine use of these biomarkers in clinical settings is still premature because of the risk of overdiagnosis, increased cost and/or invasiveness of the assessment method. Also, standardization of measures across studies is needed to assure biomarker regulatory approval.

Although there are many long term opportunities to address these issues with integrated policies, the immediate needs of addressing air pollution and climate change mitigation are not the same for all countries in the short run. We examined the relationships between greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, outdoor air pollution, and levels of socioeconomic development to identify specific near-term mitigation policy responses to climate change and air pollution for countries with different levels of human development. Human development index, as defined by The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a measure of achievement in the basic dimensions of human development across countries, which combines the gross national income index, an education index and a life expectancy index (http://hdr.undp.org/en/humandev). Country-level data were collected on indicators of socioeconomic development, emissions of GHG, and outdoor levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the World Bank, the UNDP, and the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution. Differences in GHG emissions and air pollution concentrations, as well as socioeconomic development indicators, were assessed at national, sub-national, and global scales. Countries were divided into four categories based on CO2 emissions per capita and an estimation of outdoor PM2.5: Group A was characterized by high CO2 emissions per capita and low PM2.5 concentrations, Group B by high CO2 emissions per capita and high PM2.5 concentrations, Group C by low CO2 emissions per capita and low PM2.5 concentrations, and Group D by low CO2 emissions per capita and high PM2.5 concentration. Per-capita emissions of CO2 were strongly correlated with the level of socioeconomic development, while differences in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions per capita across the groups were not correlated. Atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations were not correlated with either CO2 emissions per capita or levels of socioeconomic development. Energy and environmental policies focused on CO2 emission reductions may not inherently lead to development pathways that sufficiently reduce population exposure to air pollution. Countries with low CO2 and high air pollution levels should pursue short-term policies to reduce air pollution and increase human development, beginning to address GHG emissions after critical human health and development needs are met.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Methods: In this double-blind cluster-randomised controlled trial, 100 shared water points (clusters) in two low-income urban communities in Bangladesh were randomly assigned (1:1) to have their drinking water automatically chlorinated at the point of collection by a solid tablet chlorine doser (intervention group) or to be treated by a visually identical doser that supplied vitamin C (active control group). The trial followed an open cohort design; all children younger than 5 years residing in households accessing enrolled water points were measured every 2–3 months during a 14-month follow-up period (children could migrate into or out of the cluster). The primary outcome was caregiver-reported child diarrhoea (≥3 loose or watery stools in a 24-h period [WHO criteria]) with a 1-week recall, including all available childhood observations in the analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02606981, and is completed. Findings: Between July 5, 2015, and Nov 11, 2015, 100 water points with 920 eligible households were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to the treatment (50 water points; 517 children at baseline; 2073 child observations included in the primary analysis) or control groups (50; 519; 2154). Children in the treatment group had less WHO-defined diarrhoea than did children in the control group (control 216 [10·0%] of 2154; treatment 156 [7·5%] of 2073; prevalence ratio 0·77, 95% CI 0·65–0·91). Drinking water at the point of collection at treatment taps had detectable free chlorine residual 83% (mean 0·37 ppm) of the time compared with 0% at control taps (0·00 ppm). Interpretation: Passive chlorination at the point of collection could be an effective and scalable strategy in low-income urban settings for reducing child diarrhoea and for achieving global progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 to attain universal access to safe and affordable drinking water. Targeting a low chlorine residual (<0·5 ppm) in treated water can increase taste acceptability of chlorinated drinking water while still reducing the risk of diarrhoea.

It uses legal and economic data for 132 countries from 1966 to 2011. Previous studies and reports provide substantial evidence that LGBT people are limited in their human rights in ways that also create economic harms, such as lost labor time, lost productivity, underinvestment in human capital, and the inefficient allocation of human resources. This analysis uses a fixed effects regression approach and a newly-created dataset – Global Index on Legal Recognition of Homosexual Orientation (GILRHO) – to assess how these detriments are related to the macroeconomy. Our study finds that an additional point on the 8-point GILRHO scale of legal rights for LGB persons is associated with an increase in real GDP per capita of approximately $2000. A series of robustness checks confirm that this index continues to have a positive and statistically significant association with real GDP per capita after controlling for gender equality. In combination with the qualitative evidence from previous studies and reports, our quantitative results suggest that LGBT inclusion and economic development are mutually reinforcing. Also, a back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests that about 6% to 22% of the finding could reflect the costs to GDP of health and labor market stigmatization of LGB people. Results from this study can help to better understand how the fuller enjoyment of human rights by LGBT people can contribute to a country's economic development.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Remote sensing of water use and water stress in the African savanna ecosystem at local scale – Development and validation of a monitoring tool,/articles/remote-sensing-water-use-and-water-stress-african-savanna-ecosystem-local-scale-%E2%80%93,"This paper relates to remote sensing of water use and water stress in the African savanna ecosystem at a local scale, as well as the development and validation of a monitoring tool.
",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Savannas are among the most productive biomes of Africa, where they comprise half of its surface. They support wildlife, livestock, rangelands, crops, and livelihoods, playing an important socioeconomic role in rural areas. These water-limited ecosystems with seasonal water availability are highly sensitive to changes in both climate conditions, and in land-use/management practices. Although monitoring programs for African savanna water use have been established in certain areas, most of them are largely restricted to point based measurements or coarse scales, and are not fully capable to provide distributed timely information for planning purposes. In this study we develop a mechanism for monitoring the water used by African savanna from fine scale (meters) to watershed scale, integrating the effects of the water stress. Our hypothesis is that the Ecosystem Stress Index (ESI) is a valuable tool to downscale estimates of actual evapotranspiration at coarse scale, to high resolutions. To monitor savanna water fluxes in a semi-continuous way this study integrates two different ET-estimation approaches: KC-FAO56 model, integrating reflectance-based “crop” coefficients (SPOT 4 & 5 satellites), is used to derive unstressed savanna evapotranspiration (with high spatial resolution), and the two-source surface energy balance model -TSEB, integrating radiometric surface temperature (AATSR satellites) allows the determination of water stress across savannas (ESI, with low spatial resolution). The difference between estimated and observed surface fluxes derived from TSEB (RMSDLE = 53 Wm-2, RMSDH = 50 Wm-2, RMSDRn = 60 Wm-2, RMSDG = 21 Wm-2) were of the same magnitude as the uncertainties derived from the flux measurement system, being sufficiently accurate to be employed in a distributed way and on a more regular basis. The approach of ESI to downscale ET proved to be useful, and errors between estimated and observed daily ET (RMSD 0.6 mmday−1) were consistent with the results of other studies in savanna ecosystems. The modelling framework proposed provided an accurate representation of the natural landscape heterogeneity and local conditions, with the potential of providing information suitable from local to broader scales.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The study aims to assess the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in CLD according to age, gender and ethnicity. Methods: Clinically diagnosed CLD in the general population aged 20–59 years in the Veneto Region (North-Eastern Italy) were identified through the Adjusted Clinical Groups System, by record linkage of the archive of subjects enrolled in the Regional Health System with Hospital Discharge Records, Emergency Room visits, Chronic disease registry for copayment exemptions, and the Home care database. Age-standardized prevalence rates (PR) were computed in Italians and immigrants, based on country of citizenship. Results: Overall 22,934 subjects affected by CLD in 2016 were retrieved, 21% related to HBV and 43% to HCV infection. The prevalence of HCV-related CLD was higher in males, peaking at 50–54 years (males = 11/1000; females = 4/1000). The PR of HBV-related CLD was almost negligible in the Italian population (1/1000), and higher among immigrants, especially from East Asia (males = 17/1000; females = 11/1000) and Sub-Saharan Africa (males = 13/1000; females = 10/1000).

Anemia is intricately linked to chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal and gynecological malignancies, and autoimmune disorders. Hemorrhagic anemia results in substantial loss of blood, which causes significant alterations in all blood parameters, including reduced iron. The other type of anemia is chronic anemia syndrome (CAS), which is a constellation of disorders and chronic inflammatory events caused by an increasing anaerobic/acidic environment (promoting the growth of anaerobic organisms), inducing a defensive expenditure of alkalinizing buffers in hemoglobin (i.e. histidine), to prevent a dangerous lowering of blood pH. In this process, iron is cleaved from heme groups and transferred out of blood circulation into other organs, like the liver, appearing to be IDA, where excessive accumulation can lead to hemochromatosis, also known as ‘iron overload anemia’.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: Genetic diversity is a characteristic trait of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and has been associated with different clinical outcomes. In South Africa, HBV infection is a major public health concern. Most HBV infections are caused by genotype A strains. However rare cases of infection with HBV genotype D have been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular characteristics of a rare HBV subgenotype D4 isolate. Methods: The full-length genome of isolate ZADGM6964 was amplified in a one-step polymerase chain reaction. The amplified product was purified and cloned into a pGEM®-T Easy Vector System to investigate the genetic diversity of the viral quasi-populations. The primary isolate and clones were then directly sequenced and analysed using an array of bioinformatics software. Results: Phylogenetic analysis showed that the primary isolate and cloned sequences formed a monophyletic cluster away from subgenotype D4 reference strains. Further recombination analysis revealed that isolate ZADGM6964 was in fact a D4/E recombinant strain with breakpoints identified within the X and overlapping pre-Core/Core open reading frames with a >70% bootstrap confidence level. The recombinant genotype D4/E was found to be unique from other D/E strains archived in the genetic database, GenBank.

Spatio-temporal changes in terrestrial water storage in the Himalayan river basins and risks to water security in the region: A review,/articles/spatio-temporal-changes-terrestrial-water-storage-himalayan-river-basins-and-risks-water,"Groundwater storage (GWS) – a hidden resource underneath the land surface, plays a critical role in sustaining irrigated agriculture in these river basins, particularly during the dry season when rice crops are generally grown in irrigated lands across South Asia. Although monitoring of groundwater levels has been operational in the region for a number of decades, a basin-wide comprehensive assessment of GWS is lacking in most river basins. ",Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Nearly one-fifth of the Earth's accessible freshwater is stored in the densely-populated, alluvial floodplains of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, Irrawaddy and Meghna River Systems in the Himalayan region where extreme hydrological conditions exist due to the seasonal variability in terrestrial water storage (TWS). Groundwater storage (GWS) – a hidden resource underneath the land surface, plays a critical role in sustaining irrigated agriculture in these river basins, particularly during the dry season when rice crops are generally grown in irrigated lands across South Asia. Although monitoring of groundwater levels has been operational in the region for a number of decades, a basin-wide comprehensive assessment of GWS is lacking in most river basins. The NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites offer an opportunity to map basin-wide changes in GWS where in-situ observations are limited in time and space. GRACE-derived assessments of GWS vary substantially in these basins and have not been reconciled with in-situ observations in most cases. Recent declining trends in GWS over the Himalayan river basins are attributed primarily to over-abstraction of groundwater due to dry-season irrigation. Seasonal variability in terrestrial water is likely to increase or become unpredictable in the future as a result of increased climate variability. The consequent impacts may potentially threaten the security of water supply and food in the region, where there is currently a growing demand for food grains from irrigated agriculture, energy, and domestic and industrial water supplies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"Independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, and improved complementary feeding, on child stunting and anaemia in rural Zimbabwe: a cluster-randomised trial",/articles/independent-and-combined-effects-improved-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-and-improved,"This study supports SDGs 3 and 6 by showing that elementary WASH interventions alone were insufficient in reducing the prevalence of stunting, anaemia, and diarrhoea in children in rural Zimbabwe; these findings call for greater investment into, and scale-up of, WASH programmes in rural settings, in order to achieve more meaningful improvements in child health outcomes. 
",Goal 3: Good health and well-being; Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation,"Background: Child stunting reduces survival and impairs neurodevelopment. We tested the independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on stunting and anaemia in in Zimbabwe. Methods: We did a cluster-randomised, community-based, 2 × 2 factorial trial in two rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as the catchment area of between one and four village health workers employed by the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently lived in clusters and were confirmed pregnant. Clusters were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to standard of care (52 clusters), IYCF (20 g of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement per day from age 6 to 18 months plus complementary feeding counselling; 53 clusters), WASH (construction of a ventilated improved pit latrine, provision of two handwashing stations, liquid soap, chlorine, and play space plus hygiene counselling; 53 clusters), or IYCF plus WASH (53 clusters). A constrained randomisation technique was used to achieve balance across the groups for 14 variables related to geography, demography, water access, and community-level sanitation coverage. Masking of participants and fieldworkers was not possible. The primary outcomes were infant length-for-age Z score and haemoglobin concentrations at 18 months of age among children born to mothers who were HIV negative during pregnancy. These outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. We estimated the effects of the interventions by comparing the two IYCF groups with the two non-IYCF groups and the two WASH groups with the two non-WASH groups, except for outcomes that had an important statistical interaction between the interventions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01824940. Findings: Between Nov 22, 2012, and March 27, 2015, 5280 pregnant women were enrolled from 211 clusters. 3686 children born to HIV-negative mothers were assessed at age 18 months (884 in the standard of care group from 52 clusters, 893 in the IYCF group from 53 clusters, 918 in the WASH group from 53 clusters, and 991 in the IYCF plus WASH group from 51 clusters). In the IYCF intervention groups, the mean length-for-age Z score was 0·16 (95% CI 0·08–0·23) higher and the mean haemoglobin concentration was 2·03 g/L (1·28–2·79) higher than those in the non-IYCF intervention groups. The IYCF intervention reduced the number of stunted children from 620 (35%) of 1792 to 514 (27%) of 1879, and the number of children with anaemia from 245 (13·9%) of 1759 to 193 (10·5%) of 1845. The WASH intervention had no effect on either primary outcome. Neither intervention reduced the prevalence of diarrhoea at 12 or 18 months. No trial-related serious adverse events, and only three trial-related adverse events, were reported. Interpretation: Household-level elementary WASH interventions implemented in rural areas in low-income countries are unlikely to reduce stunting or anaemia and might not reduce diarrhoea. Implementation of these WASH interventions in combination with IYCF interventions is unlikely to reduce stunting or anaemia more than implementation of IYCF alone.

This paper aims at producing actionable knowledge in the Indian Himalayan Region for climate modelers and policy planners to better serve the nation's needs.
",Goal 13: Climate action,"Impacts of global climate change can be seen worldwide, both on developing and developed economies. In recent years, numerous researches have been carried out by the Government and Non-Government agencies in understanding, assessing, predicting, and responding to expected processes of global climate change and recommend policies for mitigation. Extreme weather events like increased precipitation, cloudbursts, flashfloods, and avalanches in the mountainous region threaten human lives, and state and national economies. In the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), well distributed hydrometeorological records (contemporary and historical) that facilitate the understanding of processes driving extreme weather events are scarce or rarely available. However, the capacity to observe, measure and quantify precipitation on regional scales has increased tremendously over the last three decades. Topography of the IHR provides favorable conditions for the cloudburst phenomenon which lead to frequent flashfloods and landslides; killing hundreds of people every year. Understanding the exact mechanism of the driving processes of cloudbursts such as orographic lifting, precipitation distribution, precipitation thresholds and its source or origin are still uncertain. Keeping in view that cloudbursts have been increasing in both their frequency and intensity, they are likely to intensify in the near future. Present study analyzes and critically summarizes facts and impacts of cloudburst events through compilation of hydrometeorological records and analysis of available data in the IHR. Results indicate that natural climate variability has played a much greater role in driving these extreme events than earlier thought. A general consensus is observed about the role of climate change, large atmospheric circulations, teleconnections and landuse–landcover changes in driving these events. Therefore, in light of such challenges and potential research gaps, this paper aims at producing actionable knowledge in the IHR for climate modelers and policy planners to better serve the nation's needs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 14: Life below water; Goal 13: Climate action,"Anthropogenic use of high density, toxic elements results in marine pollution which is bio-accumulating throughout marine food webs. While there have been several studies in various locations analyzing such elements in fish, few have investigated patterns in these elements and their isotopes in terms of ocean depth, and none have studied the greatest depth zones. We used a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer-hydride system and an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer to determine concentrations of the high-density elements arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), plus the light-metal barium (Ba), in fish ranging from bathyal (1000 m in Monterey Bay) to upper hadal zones (6500–7626 m in the Kermadec and Mariana Trenches) in the Pacific Ocean. Five species of fish—including the Mariana Trench snailfish, the world's deepest known fish newly discovered—were analyzed for patterns in total element concentration, depth of occurrence, Se:Hg ratio, plus mercury isotopes in the deepest species. Co and As levels decreased with depth. In the Mariana Trench, Pb, Hg, Cd, and Cu were higher than in all other samples, and higher in those plus Ba than in the Kermadec Trench. The latter samples had far higher Ni and Cr levels than all others. Mercury relative isotope analysis showed no depth trends in the deepest species. Se:Hg showed a large molar excess of Se in bathyal flatfish species. These patterns indicate that exposures to pollutants differ greatly between habitats including trenches of similar depths.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

",Goal 10: Reduced inequalities,"In development engineering, practitioners often strive to empower local communities through technology. Empowerment, however, is typically not well-defined and rarely assessed, leading to an erosion of its meaning. In this study, we define empowerment as capacity building through technology transfer, which we evaluate by assessing skill transfer, skill application, increased individual confidence, and community support. We test the usefulness of these assessments for participatory mapping as a form of technology transfer, using a Participatory Action Research approach. Our case is a digital mapping team embedded in the long-term community-based participatory research agenda of The Muonde Trust in Mazvihwa, Zimbabwe. We taught and evaluated mapping by conducting workshops and engaging in a variety of mapping projects (including measuring access to basic services, land-use planning, and cultural and historical preservation projects), demonstrating dramatically increased mapping skills and individual confidence, and the creation of a community of practice able to teach the skills. Our peer-based learning techniques used adult education principles and could be applied in creating other local communities of practice to support the use of medium-tech mapping methods (basic GPS units and computer mapping software). In poverty reduction and sustainability initiatives, participatory mapping can be complementary to cutting-edge big data approaches and necessary for true improvements in the well-being of the most vulnerable populations on our planet.

In latent infection, replication competent HIV-1 provirus is integrated within the host genome but remains silent, masking the infected cells from the activity of the host immune response. Despite the progress in elucidating the molecular players that regulate HIV-1 gene expression, the mechanisms driving the establishment and maintenance of latency are still not fully understood. Transcription from the HIV-1 genome occurs in the context of chromatin and is subjected to the same regulatory mechanisms that drive cellular gene expression. Much like in eukaryotic genes, the nucleosomal landscape of the HIV-1 promoter and its position within genomic chromatin are determinants of its transcriptional activity. Understanding the multilayered chromatin-mediated mechanisms that underpin HIV-1 integration and expression is of utmost importance for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the pool of latently infected cells. In this review, we discuss the impact of chromatin structure on viral integration, transcriptional regulation and latency, and the host factors that influence HIV-1 replication by regulating chromatin organization.

In modern era water harvesting has been neglected, particularly at the developed countries, due to the technological achievements in the fields of water production and transport. Nevertheless, over recent years, water harvesting in modern-urban environments becomes a necessary practice. The urban regions are being paved and built, resulting in reduction of groundwater recharge area. Consequently, large amount of good quality water that rains over the cities is withdrawn from recharge as it is directed into the municipal drainage system. Moreover, in extreme rain events the drainage systems may be over-flooded which may lead to ecologic and economic hazards. This work reviews the history of rain water harvesting and discusses the impact of rain water harvesting in modern-urban environments on the hydrological system. Two types of rain water harvesting methods are being discussed and compared: storing of the harvested water in reservoirs and direct infiltration of the harvested water into the aquifer. Quantitative examples from Tel-Aviv, Israel are given and indicate that rain water harvesting may play an important role in the local and regional hydrological cycle and that direct infiltration of the harvested water into the aquifer is preferable for heavily populated cities.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Although rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a potential solution to manage stormwater in urban areas, its benefits in mitigating the climate change impacts on combined sewer networks have not been assessed yet. Hence, the goal of the present study was set to evaluate the effectiveness of RWH in alleviating the potential impacts of climate change on CSOs. To do so, first, future rainfall was achieved through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) based on modified historical record. Then, rainfall-runoff modeling was employed using the U.S. EPA Stormwater management model (SWMM) to study the response of CSO outfalls to future rainfall. The study site was the combined sewer network of the City of Toledo, Ohio. Results showed that under the maximum impact scenario in the near future, climate change might cause up to approximately 12–18% increase in CSOs occurrence, volume and duration in Toledo. However, an RWH plan with the capacity of 0.76 m3 (200 gal) implemented on half on the buildings throughout the area, appeared to be able to mitigate the potential future impacts, and showed a remarkable controlling performance in the peak flow periods. This plan also met toilet flushing demands. Therefore, RWH can be considered as a feasible solution to mitigate future climate change impacts on CSOs and supply water demands.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Despite the fact that there is plenty of theoretical work on quality standards for indicators, in practice users cannot often be sure how adequately the indicators measure the monitored phenomena. Therefore we stress the need to operationalise the Sustainable Development Goals' targets and evaluate the indicators' relevance, the characteristic of utmost importance among the indicators' quality traits. The current format of the proposed SDGs and their targets has laid a policy framework; however, without thorough expert and scientific follow up on their operationalisation the indicators may be ambiguous. Therefore we argue for the foundation of a conceptual framework for selecting appropriate indicators for targets from existing sets or formulating new ones. Experts should focus on the ""indicator-indicated fact"" relation to ensure the indicators' relevance in order for clear, unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users (decision- and policy-makers and also the lay public).

Three research trajectories with example research questions are presented to that end: (1) disrupting heteronormativity; (2) queering accounting organisations; (3) queer allies in accounting contexts.

CD4+ T lymphocytes play a central coordinating role in adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses, and to do so they migrate and interact within lymphoid compartments and at effector sites to mount immune responses. While cell-free virus serves as an excellent prognostic indicator for patient survival, interactions of infected T cells or virus-scavenging immune cells with uninfected T cells can greatly enhance viral spread. HIV can induce interactions between infected and uninfected T cells that are triggered by cell surface expression of viral Env, which serves as a cell adhesion molecule that interacts with CD4 on the target cell, before it acts as the viral membrane fusion protein. These interactions are called virological synapses and promote replication in the face of selective pressure of humoral immune responses and antiretroviral therapy. Other infection-enhancing cell-cell interactions occur between virus-concentrating antigen-presenting cells and recipient T cells, called infectious synapses. The exact roles that these cell-cell interactions play in each stage of infection, from viral acquisition, systemic dissemination, to chronic persistence are still being determined. Infection-promoting immune cell interactions are likely to contribute to viral persistence and enhance the ability of HIV-1 to evade adaptive immune responses. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The associated livestock production requires large areas of land and lead to high nitrogen and greenhouse gas emission levels. Although several studies have examined the potential impact of dietary changes on greenhouse gas emissions and land use, those on health, the agricultural system and other environmental aspects (such as nitrogen emissions) have only been studied to a limited extent. By using biophysical models and methods, we examined the large-scale consequences in the European Union of replacing 25-50% of animal-derived foods with plant-based foods on a dietary energy basis, assuming corresponding changes in production. We tested the effects of these alternative diets and found that halving the consumption of meat, dairy products and eggs in the European Union would achieve a 40% reduction in nitrogen emissions, 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 23% per capita less use of cropland for food production. In addition, the dietary changes would also lower health risks. The European Union would become a net exporter of cereals, while the use of soymeal would be reduced by 75%. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of the food system would increase from the current 18% to between 41% and 47%, depending on choices made regarding land use. As agriculture is the major source of nitrogen pollution, this is expected to result in a significant improvement in both air and water quality in the EU. The resulting 40% reduction in the intake of saturated fat would lead to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. These diet-led changes in food production patterns would have a large economic impact on livestock farmers and associated supply-chain actors, such as the feed industry and meat-processing sector. © 2014 The Authors.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
Health consequences of exposure to e-waste: A systematic review,/articles/health-consequences-exposure-e-waste-systematic-review,"This Article supports SDG 3 by showing plausible outcomes associated with exposure to e-waste (end-of-life electrical and electronic waste), including change in thyroid function, changes in cellular expression and function, adverse neonatal outcomes, changes in temperament and behaviour, and decreased lung function.",Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Background: The population exposed to potentially hazardous substances through inappropriate and unsafe management practices related to disposal and recycling of end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment, collectively known as e-waste, is increasing. We aimed to summarise the evidence for the association between such exposures and adverse health outcomes. Methods: We systematically searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycNET, and CINAHL) for studies assessing the association between exposure to e-waste and outcomes related to mental health and neurodevelopment, physical health, education, and violence and criminal behaviour, from Jan 1, 1965, to Dec 17, 2012, and yielded 2274 records. Of the 165 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, we excluded a further 142, resulting in the inclusion of 23 published epidemiological studies that met the predetermined criteria. All studies were from southeast China. We assessed evidence of a causal association between exposure to e-waste and health outcomes within the Bradford Hill framework. Findings: We recorded plausible outcomes associated with exposure to e-waste including change in thyroid function, changes in cellular expression and function, adverse neonatal outcomes, changes in temperament and behaviour, and decreased lung function. Boys aged 8-9 years living in an e-waste recycling town had a lower forced vital capacity than did those living in a control town. Significant negative correlations between blood chromium concentrations and forced vital capacity in children aged 11 and 13 years were also reported. Findings from most studies showed increases in spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and premature births, and reduced birthweights and birth lengths associated with exposure to e-waste. People living in e-waste recycling towns or working in e-waste recycling had evidence of greater DNA damage than did those living in control towns. Studies of the effects of exposure to e-waste on thyroid function were not consistent. One study related exposure to e-waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment to educational outcomes. Interpretation: Although data suggest that exposure to e-waste is harmful to health, more well designed epidemiological investigations in vulnerable populations, especially pregnant women and children, are needed to confirm these associations. © 2013 Grant et al.

Nonetheless, even with sustained suppression of HIV replication, many HIV-infected persons experience a syndrome characterized by increased T cell activation and evidence of heightened inflammation and coagulation. This residual immune dysregulation syndrome or RIDS is more common in persons who fail to increase circulating CD4. + T cells to normal levels and in several epidemiologic studies it has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. These morbid and fatal events are not the typical opportunistic infections and malignancies seen in the early AIDS era but rather comprise a spectrum of cardiovascular events, liver disease, metabolic disorders, kidney disease, bone disease, and a spectrum of malignant complications distinguishable from the opportunistic malignancies that characterized the earlier days of the AIDS epidemic.While immune activation, inflammation, and coagulopathy are characteristic of untreated HIV infection and improve with drug-induced control of HIV replication, the drivers of RIDS in treated HIV infection are incompletely understood. And while inflammation, immune activation, and coagulopathy are more common in treated persons who fail to restore circulating CD4. + T cells, it is not entirely clear how these two phenomena are linked. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Posttraumatic stress disorder in infants and young children exposed to war-related trauma,/articles/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-infants-and-young-children-exposed-war-related-trauma,This article ties to SDG 3. This article examined the development of PTSD in infants and young children 1.5 to 5 years of age exposed to war-related trauma over a lengthy period. ,Goal 3: Good health and well-being,"Objective: Although millions of the world's children are growing up amidst armed conflict, little research has described the specific symptom manifestations and relational behavior in young children exposed to wartime trauma or assessed factors that chart pathways of risk and resilience. Method: Participants included 232 Israeli children 1.5 to 5 years of age, 148 living near the Gaza Strip and exposed to daily war-related trauma and 84 controls. Children's symptoms were diagnosed, maternal and child attachment-related behaviors observed during the evocation of traumatic memories, and maternal psychological symptoms and social support were self-reported. Results: PTSD was diagnosed in 37.8% of war-exposed children (n = 56). Children with PTSD exhibited multiple posttraumatic symptoms and substantial developmental regression. Symptoms observed in more than 60% of diagnosed children included nonverbal representation of trauma in play; frequent crying, night waking, and mood shifts; and social withdrawal and object focus. Mothers of children with PTSD reported the highest depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms and the lowest social support, and displayed the least sensitivity during trauma evocation. Attachment behavior of children in the Exposed-No-PTSD group was characterized by use of secure-base behavior, whereas children with PTSD showed increased behavioral avoidance. Mother's, but not child's, degree of trauma exposure and maternal PTSD correlated with child avoidance. Conclusions: Large proportions of young children exposed to repeated wartime trauma exhibit a severe posttraumatic profile that places their future adaptation at significant risk. Although more resilient children actively seek maternal support, avoidance signals high risk. Maternal well-being, sensitive behavior, and support networks serve as resilience factors and should be the focus of interventions for families of war-exposed infants and children. © 2011 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Method: Maltreated (n = 91) and nonmaltreated (n = 43) school-age children individually participated in a story game designed to elicit speech samples. Children were instructed to listen to two recorded stories and prompted to retell the story; they then were asked to create their own story from possible topics. Child behavior ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist were completed by research assistants following 35 hours of observation. Results: Maltreated children exhibited more illogical thinking than did nonmaltreated children, and the level of illogical thinking in maltreated children was in the clinically pathological range. The occurrence of multiple subtypes of maltreatment and the chronicity of the maltreatment also were associated with illogical thinking. Dissociation did not differ between groups, although it was related to illogical thinking. Conclusion: The ability to formulate ideas and communicate them logically is compromised in children who have been maltreated.

The objective of this study is to describe the effects of a universal, teacher-based preventive intervention implemented with Israeli students before the rocket attacks that occurred during Operation Cast Lead, compared with a nonintervention but exposed control group. Method: The study sample consisted of 1,488 students studying in fourth and fifth grades in a city in southern Israel who were exposed to continuous rocket attacks during Operation Cast Lead. The intervention group included about half (53.5%) of the children who studied in six schools where the teacher-led intervention was implemented 3 months before the traumatic exposure. The control group (46.5% of the sample) included six schools matched by exposure in which the preventive intervention was not implemented. Children filled out the UCLA-PTSD Reaction Index and the Stress/Mood Scale 3 months after the end of the rocket attacks. Results: The intervention group displayed significantly lower symptoms of posttrauma and stress/mood than the control group (p < .001). Control children had 57% more detected cases of postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than participant children. This difference was significantly more pronounced among boys (10.2% versus 4.4%) and less among girls (12.5% versus10.1%). Conclusions: The teacher-based, resilience-focused intervention is a universal, cost-effective approach to enhance the preparedness of communities of children to mass trauma and to prevent the development of PTSD after exposure. © 2011 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
